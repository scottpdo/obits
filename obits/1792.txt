# Robert Adam

Adam had long suffered from stomach and bowel problems, probably caused by a peptic ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome. While at home – 11 Albermarle Street, London – on 1 March 1792, one of the ulcers burst, and on 3 March Adam died.

The funeral was held on 10 March; he was buried in the south aisle of Westminster Abbey. The pall-bearers were several of his clients: Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch; George Coventry, 6th Earl of Coventry; James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale; David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield; Lord Frederick Campbell and Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet.

Knowing he was dying, he drafted his will on 2 March 1792. Having never married, Adam left his estate to his sisters Elizabeth Adam and Margaret Adam.

His obituary appeared in the March 1792 edition of The Gentleman's Magazine:

He left nearly 9,000 drawings, 8,856 of which (by both Robert and James Adam) were subsequently purchased in 1833 for £200 by the architect John Soane and are now at the Soane Museum in London.

# Karl Josef von Bachmann

Major Bachmann was in direct charge of the 900 Swiss Guards present during the 10 August Insurrection, when revolutionaries stormed the palace of the Tuileries. The nominal commander of the Guard, the elderly Colonel d'Affrey, was in poor health and had delegated Bachmann to bring the regiment into central Paris during the evening of 9 August. Having deployed his Swiss to defend the palace Major Bachman escorted King Louis XVI and the Royal Family to the National Assembly where they sought refuge. About 650 Swiss Guards were killed, either during the fighting which broke out spontaneously shortly afterwards, or after surrender.   

Arrested by the revolutionaries Major Bachmann was accused of treason for ordering the Swiss Guard to resist the storming of the royal palace and thereby offending the "Majesty of the People". Bachmann refused to acknowledge the tribunal which was trying him, as the Swiss soldiers in French service were entitled to be tried by their own courts. His trial was interrupted in the late afternoon of 2 September 1792 when the September Massacres of hundreds of political prisoners took place at the Conciergerie and Abbaye prisons. A lynch mob invaded the courtroom where Major Bachmann and other Swiss Guards were being tried before the official Tribunal of 17 August. The crowd retreated when ordered to clear the room by the presiding judges and Bachmann "passed through their shambles unharmed on his way to the scaffold".

Bachmann was then sentenced to death, and guillotined on 3 September 1792. He stepped onto the scaffold still wearing the red uniform of the Swiss Guard and his countenance struck those who watched so much that he was remembered by the French poet Lamartine in one of his works.

# Stephen Blucke

# John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute

He died on 10 March 1792 at his London address, South Audley Street off Grosvenor Square.

# Arabella Denny

Arabella Denny retired in 1790 and died in Dublin on 18 March 1792. She had a fear of being buried alive and left instructions that she should not be removed from her deathbed for at least seventy-two hours.

# Dragging Canoe

Dragging Canoe died February 29, 1792 at Running Water Town, from exhaustion (or possibly a heart attack) after dancing all night celebrating the recent conclusion of an alliance with the Muskogee and the Choctaw.  The Chickamauga were also celebrating a recent victory by one of their war bands against the Cumberland settlements.

# Angelo Emo

On 6 March 1784 he was elected as Capitano Straordinario delle Navi (commander-in-chief of the sail fleet) against the Beylik of Tunis, which had declared war on the Republic after a Venetian ship laden with goods from the Barbary coast was burned by the authorities in Malta due to it being infected with the plague. On 21 June, Emo sailed from Venice for Corfu at the head of a squadron composed of the ships of the line Fama, Forza, Palma, Vittoria, and Eolo, the frigates Concordia, Sirena, Brillante, Pallade, and Venere, the bombard Distruzione, the galiot Esploratore, the xebecs Cupido and Nettuno, and the hospital ship Kav. Angelo. 

On 12 August 1784, his squadron anchored at Cap Carthage, five miles from Tunis. In a series of expeditions over the next three years, he repeatedly bombarded Sousse (5 October 1784, for three nights in April 1785, and in 26 September–6 October 1787), Biserte (30 May to 10 August 1787), Sfax (15–17 August 1785, and 6, 18, and 22 March, 30 April and 4 May 1786), and La Goulette (on 1, 3, 5, 9 October 1758), where he utilized floating batteries of his own invention. These operations not only caused great damage and casualties in these cities, but also confined the Tunisian fleet to its harbours. The Senate rejected his requests ofr a 10,000-man expeditionary force  with which to assault and capture Tunis, however. Instead, in 1787, the Bey of Tunis was forced to sign a treaty with the Republic of Venice, granting it favourable trade terms: the tax rate for goods carried on Venetian merchant ships fell from 7% to 4%, although for its part the Republic was obliged to pay a lump sum of 40,000 sequins. In the meantime, on 28 May 1786, Emo had been elected Procuratore de Ultra of St Mark's Basilica.

The treaty did not last long, however, before the Tunisians resumed their raids. Emo led a squadron to the Aegean against them, but lost two ships in a storm. The government of the Republic confiscated his possessions to repay the lost ships. In late 1790, the Senate named him Provveditore Generale da Mar, but did not entrust him with leading the fleet against the Tunisian coast. With the French Revolution under way in Europe, the Senate was loath to become embroiled in a prolonged conflict, and preferred peace. The Senate feared that Emo's aggressive nature would hamper these efforts, and instead placed the Almirante Tommaso Condulmer, promoted to Capitano delle Navi, in charge of the naval blockade and the peace negotiations. While waiting to join with the rest of the fleet at Malta, Emo died on 1 March 1792, reportedly from a bilious attack after learning that a peace, mostly disadvantageous to Venice, had been concluded with Tunis without his being consulted.

Celebrated as a great naval hero, his body was embalmed and carried to Venice on board his flagship, the ship of the line Fama. The sculptor Antonio Canova was charged with erecting a monument to Emo. Completed in 1794, it is in the second armoury of the Venetian Arsenal. Canova was honoured by the Republic with a medal for this monument, the last such medal issued by the Republic before its end. His funeral took place at St Mark's on 17 April, and he was buried at the church of Santa Maria dei Servi. A funerary monument was erected over his tomb by Canova's teacher, Giovanni Ferrari, initially at Santa Maria dei Servi, then moved to San Martino, and finally, from 1817, to San Biagio.

# Alexander Falconbridge

In 1791, Falconbridge was selected by the Anti-Slavery Society to sail to Sierra Leone with his wife Anna Maria; and his brother William, with the intent of reorganising the failed settlement of freed slaves in Granville Town, Sierra Leone.

Unfortunately, his wife Anna Maria did not share his idealistic views about the settlement. The couple quarrelled; Falconbridge began to drink excessively, due to marital problems and ailing health and, it would seem, disenchantment with the Sierra Leone Company. A number of Falconbridge's contemporaries were dismissed for vague reasons and it may be that the Company used them as scapegoats. Dismissals included Charles Horwood brother of Anna Maria, Isaac DuBois, Anna's second husband, and eventually Clarkson himself.

Falconbridge eventually died of drink a week before Christmas 1792. Henry Thornton, chairman of the Sierra Leone Company, replaced him as the company's commercial agent only hours before his death. The Sierra Leone company refused to acknowledge the claim of his wife Anna Maria for monies owed to her late husband and, perhaps conveniently, the company records went missing.

# William Gooch (astronomer)

In Gooch's final letter to his parents, written on 2 May 1792, he speaks of his concerns over having used a false meridian and his hopes of being re-united with them in the autumn of 1794. On 11 May 1792, Lieutenant Richard Hergest, commander of the Daedalus, embarked on the ship's cutter along with Gooch and a small crew to trade with the locals and re-supply with fresh water at Waimea on Oahu, in the Hawaiian islands. The party was attacked by Pahupu (Hawaiian warriors) on 12 May. Hergest, Gooch and a sailor were cut off from the rest of the group and killed.

Gooch's story is recorded in his letters, many of which were to his parents, and journal which are housed as part of the Board of Longitude archive at Cambridge University Library.

His biography, The Death of William Gooch: A History's Anthropology, was written in 1995 by Greg Dening and illustrates the dangers of cross-cultural encounters in the exploration era.

# Antoine Galiot Mandat de Grancey

# William Inglis (surgeon)

William Inglis died at Edinburgh on 10 July 1792.

# John Paul Jones

In May 1790, Jones arrived in Paris. He still retained his position as Russian rear admiral, with a corresponding pension which allowed him to remain in retirement until his death two years later, although he made a number of attempts to re-enter the service in the Russian navy. By this time, his memoirs had been published in Edinburgh. Inspired by them, James Fenimore Cooper and Alexandre Dumas later wrote their own adventure novels. Jones also appeared in a cameo in Herman Melville's book "Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile".

In June 1792, Jones was appointed U.S. Consul to treat with the Dey of Algiers for the release of American captives. Before Jones was able to fulfill his appointment, he was found dead lying face-down on his bed in his third-floor Paris apartment, No. 19 Rue de Tournon, on July 18, 1792. He was 45 years old. The cause of death was interstitial nephritis. A small procession of servants, friends and loyal family walked his body the four miles (6.4 km) for burial. He was buried in Paris at the Saint Louis Cemetery, which belonged to the French royal family. Four years later, France's revolutionary government sold the property and the cemetery was forgotten. In 1906, the corporal remains of John Paul Jones were interred into the crypt beneath the Annapolis, Maryland, Naval Academy in a ceremony presided over by President Theodore Roosevelt.

# Zephaniah Kingsley Sr.

In 1791, the Kingsleys moved to Wilmington, North Carolina. Zephaniah Kingsley Sr. probably died a year later. His wife Isabella died in New York City on December 14, 1814, at age 77 and was buried at the Quakers' Houston Street Cemetery in Manhattan.

# Henry Laurens

Laurens died on December 8, 1792, at his estate, Mepkin. In his will he stated he wished to be cremated, and his ashes be interred at his estate. It is reported[by whom?] that his was the first formal cremation in United States. Afterward, the estate passed through several hands.  Large portions of the estate still exist and are used today as a Trappist abbey.

# John Leveson-Gower (Royal Navy officer)

He died of a stroke while shaving on 15 August 1792 at his house at Bill Hill, Wokingham, and was buried on 23 August at Barkham parish church, Berkshire. He had married Frances Boscawen, eldest daughter of Admiral the Hon. Edward Boscawen on 5 July 1773. They had several sons, including John, who became a general and MP, Edward, who became a rear-admiral, and Augustus, who was a captain and drowned aged 21. The small town of North Gower, Canada is named after him.

# Maria Clotilde of Naples and Sicily

Both Maria Clotilde and her sister Maria Henrietta of Naples and Sicily were very sensible children with a very frail health. In the case of Maria Clotilde, this was the result of a cold in 1786, when the princess was just a few days old. In 1789, Maria Clotide caught smallpox from her brothers, Prince Gennaro of Naples and Sicily and Carlo Gennaro. She then passed it on to her sister Maria Henrietta, but both recovered yet they remained very very frail and the smallpox returned to Maria Clotide in September 1792, who yet again passed it on to her sister, the two dying within ten days of each other.

# Maria Henrietta of Naples and Sicily

Maria Henrietta caught smallpox in 1789 and, allegedly, again in September 1792.[dubious  – discuss]

# Marie Thérèse Louise of Savoy, Princesse de Lamballe

During the September Massacres, the prisons were attacked by mobs, and the prisoners were placed before hastily assembled people's tribunals, who judged and executed them summarily. Each prisoner was asked a handful of questions, after which the prisoner was either freed with the words 'Vive la nation', and permitted to leave, or sentenced to death with the words 'Conduct him to the Abbaye' or 'Let him go', after which the condemned was taken to a yard where they were immediately killed by a mob consisting of men, women and children.
The massacres were opposed by the staff of the prison, who allowed many prisoners to escape, particularly women.  Of about two hundred women, only two were ultimately killed in the prison.

Pauline de Tourzel was smuggled out of the prison, but her mother and de Lamballe were too famous to be smuggled out.  Their escape would have risked attracting too much notice.   Almost all women prisoners tried before the tribunals in La Force were freed from charges. Among them was Lamballe's colleague, the lady-in-waiting Louise-Emmanuelle de Châtillon, Princesse de Tarente.  Indeed, not only the former royal governess de Tourzel, but also four other women formerly employed at the royal household, Marie-Élisabeth Thibault and Bazile (former ladies-maids of the queen), St Brice (nurse of the Dauphin), Navarre (lady's maid of Lamballe), as well as de Septeuil (wife of the kings valet), where all put before the tribunals but freed of charges, as were even two male members of the royal household, the valets of the king and dauphin, Chamilly and Hue.  Lamballe was therefore to be somewhat of an exception.

On 3 September, de Lamballe and de Tourzel were taken out to a courtyard with other prisoners waiting to be taken to the tribunal.
She was brought before a hastily assembled tribunal which demanded she "take an oath to love liberty and equality and to swear hatred to the King and the Queen and to the monarchy".
She agreed to take the oath to liberty but refused to denounce the king, queen and monarchy.  At this point, her trial was summarily ended with the words, "emmenez madame" ("Take madame away"). She was in the company of de Tourzel until she was called into the tribunal, and the exact wording of the summary trial is stated to have consisted of the following swift interrogation:

She was immediately taken to the street to a group of men who killed her within minutes.

There are many different versions of the exact manner of her death, which attracted great attention and was used in propaganda for many years after the revolution, during which it was embellished and exaggerated. Some reports, for example, allege that she was raped, and her breasts sliced off in addition to other bodily mutilations.
There is, however, nothing to indicate that she was exposed to any sexual mutilations or atrocities, which was widely alleged in the sensationalist stories surrounding her infamous death. She was escorted by two guards to the door of the yard where the massacre was taking place; on her way there, the agents of her father-in-law followed and again encouraged her to swear the oath, but she appeared not to hear them.
When the door was opened and she was exposed to the sight of bloody corpses in the yard, she reportedly cried 'Fi horreur!' or 'I am lost!', fell back, but was pulled out into the front of the yard by the two guards. Reportedly, the agents of her father-in-law were among the crowd, crying 'Grâce! Grâce!', but were soon silenced with the shouts of 'Death to the disguised lackeys of the Duc de Penthièvre!' One of the killers, who were tried years later, described her as 'a little lady dressed in white', standing for a moment alone. Reportedly, she was first struck by a man with a pike on her head, which caused her hair to fall down upon her shoulders, revealing a letter from Marie Antoinette which she had hidden in her hair; she was then wounded on the forehead, which caused her to bleed, after which she was very swiftly stabbed to death by the crowd.

# Muhammadquli Khan

Characterized by Abbasgulu Bakikhanov as "generous but harsh" person, he died in 1792 in Baku and was buried in Karbala.He was succeeded by his nephew - Huseyngulu Khan.

# Frederick North, Lord North

# George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney

Rodney arrived home in August to receive unbounded honour from his country. He had already been created Baron Rodney of Rodney Stoke, Somerset, by patent of 19 June 1782, and the House of Commons had voted him a pension of £2000 a year. From this time he led a quiet country life until his death in London. He was succeeded as 2nd Baron by his son, George (1753–1802).

In 1782 Rodney was presented with the Freedom of the City of Cork, Ireland.  The National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, holds the gold presentation box that the City of Cork gave him on 16 September 1782.

Rodney died in 1792, and was buried in the church of St Mary the Virgin, Old Alresford, in Hampshire, which adjoins his family seat.

# François-Louis de Saillans

Saillans tried to flee into Lozère dressed as a peasant, heading for Elze (now in the commune of Malons), where he stayed a night in a partisan's house. He was accompanied by an old man called Nadal, his valet and two priests, abbé Pradon, parish priest of Bannes and abbé Boissin, parish priest of Puech. At 7 am on 12 July the five men set off towards Villefort, but near the hamlet of Aidons they met a National Guard patrol commanded by Laurent, formerly a non-commissioned officer in the régiment de Hainaut.

They were arrested, taken to Laurent's house and interrogated. Saillans tried to pass himself off as the parish priest of Barjac and quickly tried to get rid of his papers in a nearby stable. However, Laurent spotted him, seized the papers and told Saillans that he recognised him. In his Conspirations royalistes du midi sous la Révolution, Ernest Daudet states that Saillans did not deny it and told Laurent "I'm in your hands, here is my cross, free me and wish me good luck in my enterprise and I'll give you fifty louis". Laurent refused and Saillans tried to strangle him, crying "If it was just you and me, without your comrades, I'd make you do what I want". Laurent threw him off and summoned his soldiers. The prisoners were sent to Les Vans and cut down with sabres in place de la Grave without trial - a cross still marks the site. His body was buried in a common grave at Les Vans, whilst a man from Largentière called La Paille took Saillans' head back to Largentière on a pike - it was buried there in a common grave on the river bank, where it was rediscovered in 1894 whilst digging the foundations for a house and taken to the village church, where the skull can still be seen atop a capital.

Saillans had not seen his 47-year-old wife Françoise since he set off on his Ardéche expedition - she died later at Tour Gaffey in Avallon (where Saillans' mother, aunt and daughter also died). Their second child was Julie (7 April 1783, Avallon - 11 July 1857, near Avallon), whose godfather was Jules-David de Cromot. On 11 firmaire, year IV (1805), Julie married Michel-Auguste Guillier de Monts, from an old Nivernais family - he too was then living in Avallon and later became mayor of Annéot. He and Julie had three children - Charles, Ernest and Léonie - before she died in 1857 in the small château d'Annéot near Avallon. Léonie went on to marry Victor-Philippe Goupilleau.

# Robert Strange (engraver)

Strange died at his house, No. 52 Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 5 July 1792, and was buried at St. Paul's, Covent Garden. Besides Strange's portrait by Greuze, there is a portrait by Romney and one by Raeburn.

# James Sykes (Continental Congress)

Sykes died in Dover, Delaware on April 4, 1792 and is buried at Christ Episcopal Church there. His son, James Sykes Jr., served as Governor of Delaware, and his great-grandson George served as a Major General in the American Civil War.

# Philip Thicknesse

Thicknesse died on one such journey near Boulogne, Pas-de-Calais, France, and was buried in this town. In his later life he had become an "ornamental hermit".

In his will he stipulated that his right hand be cut off, and that it should be delivered to his son, George, who was inattentive.  The will stated that the reason was "to remind him of his duty to God after having so long abandoned the duty he owed to a father, who once so affectionately loved him."

# Nicolas Félix Vandive

It was Nicolas Felix Vandive who at the time of the last disease of the king Louis XV was sent the Sunday the 1st er May 1774 by the Parlement of Paris to go to enquérir itself of the health of the king, as we learns it in his famous newspaper the Parisian bookseller Siméon-Prosper Hardy:

“ new court of the Parliament avoit not missed, according to the ordinary use, to appoint named Vandive, one of the first principal clerks at the clerk's office of Large the Room and its notaries secretaries, to go to Versailles knowledge of the news of the health of the King. But this secretary pouvoit to give an account of its mission to the irremovable company only next Tuesday, awaited accustomed vacancy of the Monday, May 2. ”

Nicolas Felix Vandive exerted the load anoblissante "to advise notary secretary House and Crown of France", we give below a copy of the letters of provisions preserved at the PUBLIC RECORDS OF FRANCE.

# James Warden

Warden had an altercation with a neighbouring landowner, Norman Bond. When Warden and Bond met in the street, an argument ensued in which Warden became extremely abusive and threatened to shoot Bond's dogs. Bond demanded Warden apologise, Warden refused, and so Bond challenged Warden to a duel. The time and place were quickly set and the duellers met at Hunters' Lodge on the morning of 28 April 1792.

According to contemporary sources, Warden's wife, Elizabeth, did not oppose the duel, and in fact, seemed to support it. She made no attempt to alert the authorities about the impending bloodshed, even though one of her neighbours was a magistrate. She was the one who had obtained the pistols for the duel. On the day of the duel, as Bond had issued the challenge, Warden took the first shot. Bond had a narrow escape as the ball passed straight through his hat. Bond now took his shot and Warden fell to the ground. He had been shot through the heart and died almost instantly.

There is a memorial tomb for James Warden in the churchyard of the St Andrew's Church at Charmouth.
