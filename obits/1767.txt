# Matthew Dubourg

In 1752, Dubourg became Master of the Royal Chapel in London, a post he occupied until his death in 1767. On 3 July 1767 Dubourg made a brief will leaving most of his estate to his wife Frances, and he died shortly thereafter. There is some question on the date of death, but his registered date of death is 5 July 1767.  The inscription on his tombstone reads:

"Here lyeth the body of Matthew Dubourg, chief composer and master of music in the kingdom of Ireland, servant to four generations of the illustrious House of Hanover, George I. and II., his Royal Highness the late Prince of Wales, and His present Majesty; as also instructor in Music to their Royal Highnesses the Duke of Cumberland and the late Prince Frederick. He died July 5, 1767, aged 64."

Tho' sweet Orpheus thou couds't

Bring

Soft pleadings from the trembling string

Unmov'd the King of Terror stands,

Nor owns the magic of thy hands

# Ekkathat

Siamese chronicles said Ekkathat died upon having been in starvation for more than ten days while concealing himself at Ban Chik Woods (Thai: ป่าบ้านจิก), adjacent to Wat Sangkhawat (Thai: วัดสังฆาวาส).:356 His dead body was discovered by a monk. It was buried at a mound named "Khok Phra Men" (Thai: โคกพระเมรุ), in front of a revered Siamese temple called "Phra Wihan Phra Mongkhonlabophit" (Thai: พระวิหารพระมงคลบพิตร).

The Burmese occupation did not last long. By the end of 1767, the remaining Burmese troops in Siam had been recalled to defend their homeland against the Chinese invasions (1765–1769), leaving Siam in a power vacuum. Taksin (governor of Tak) founded the Kingdom of Thonburi in 1768, and emerged as the primary contender by 1769.

# Nicholas Fazakerley

# Kitty Fisher


The first artist known to have painted her was Joshua Reynolds. In addition to the portraits made famous through engraved prints that were marketed directly to the public, he did several other painting of Fisher that suggest a more intimate, private view. Some of these appear to be unfinished studies. 
Nathaniel Hone painted her at least once in 1765, at the height of her popularity, and possibly a second time as well. His famous painting, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, shows her with a kitten ('kitty'), which is trying to get at a goldfish in a bowl ('fisher'). Reflected in the bowl are the faces of a crowd of people, looking through a window.

Besides sitting multiple times for Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds, she may have been painted by Philip Mercier, James Northcote, and Richard Purcell, among others.

Apart from the letters of Giustiniana Wynne, she is mentioned in the diaries and letters of people as varied as Madame D'Arblay and Horace Walpole.

In 1766, she married John Norris, son of the M.P. for Rye and grandson of Admiral Sir John Norris. She came to live at her husband's family house, Hemsted (now the premises of the prestigious English public school, Benenden School). Some sources say she settled into the proper role of mistress of Hemsted, building up Norris's fortune and enjoying the company of the local folk, who liked her for her generosity to the poor. Unfortunately, she died only four months after her marriage, some sources say from the effects of lead-based cosmetics (although this may be a confusion with the fate of her rival Lady Coventry), some from smallpox or consumption, in 1767. She was buried in Benenden churchyard dressed in her best ball gown.

# Johann Dietrich von Hülsen

After the war, Hülsen was honored by Frederick II with the post of governor of Berlin on 23 August 1763, and in 1766 was charged with a court investigation against the financial councilor Erhard Ursinus. In October, he fell ill and died on 29 May 1767 in Berlin. He was buried in the garrison church on 1 June.

In 1851, Hülsen was included on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great as one of Frederick's principal generals.

# Henry I'Anson

I'Anson died on 29 October 1767 while in active service on the Tamar.

# Thomas Johnston (engraver)

Johnston died at the age of 59 in Boston of apoplexy on May 8, 1767. He is buried at the King's Chapel Burying Ground near King’s Chapel church in Boston. He had three sons that survived him.

# Frederick William von Kleist

Kleist spent the remaining years of his life between Berlin and his estate near Liegnitz, where he died on 28 August 1768, one day short of his 43rd birthday. Frederick memorialized Kleist with a plaque on the obelisk in his castle grounds of Rheinsberg; in 1851, the King's great-great nephew, Frederick William III memorialized Kleist on the base of the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin, next to the cavalry figure of Duke Ferdinand von Braunschweig.

# Maria Josepha of Bavaria

On 28 May 1767, after only two years of marriage, Maria Josepha died of smallpox as had her predecessor Isabella. Upon the young empress' death, the Court immediately plunged into mourning. Her husband did not visit her during her illness, although her mother-in-law, Maria Theresa, did. In doing so, Maria Theresa also caught the disease, but survived.

In Joseph's first reaction to receiving the news of his wife's death, he had told some of his intimates some remarks which imply regrets for the coldness he had shown to her. He further brought himself to tell his sister-in-law, Duchess Maria Antonia, that his wife had been "for so many reasons worthy of respect". Maria Josepha was buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna, but Joseph did not attend her burial.

The unloved young empress played a role in her husband's life once more after her death, when he laid claim to a large part of Bavaria in 1778–1779. He based his claim on, among other grounds, his marriage to his Bavarian second wife. This conflict eventually grew into the War of the Bavarian Succession. In the end, the Habsburg dynasty gained only the Innviertel.

# Catherine Suckling

Catherine died on 26 December 1767 at the age of 42, leaving Edmund with eight children. A grief-stricken Edmund buried her four days later in the church at Burnham Thorpe. He never remarried. Catherine's mother, Ann, died shortly afterwards. Maurice Suckling, Edmund's brother-in-law, visited the rectory to attend the funerals, and found Edmund heart-broken, and fearing for the future for his children. He had begun to call in favours with relatives to ensure that educations and positions could be found for them, and Suckling promised to do what he could for one of the boys, using the patronage available to him as a naval captain. This saw the start of Horatio's successful career in the Royal Navy.

Horatio was nine when his mother died, but remembered her with fondness. He recalled a line from Henry V when he did so and said that it could be seen in the tears in his eyes. He would also recall her hatred for the French.

# Jonathan Tyers

Tyers died at his home in Vauxhall pleasure gardens on either 26 June or 1 July 1767. The Denbies estate was subsequently sold, and his sons Thomas and Jonathan became joint proprietors of the pleasure garden.

# Georges Vallon

He died in 1767.

# Roger Wolcott (Connecticut)

Wolcott died at home in Windsor and is interred at the Old Burying Ground (Palisado Cemetery) there.

# James Worsdale

He died in London on 19 June 1767, aged 75, and was buried in St. Paul's, Covent Garden On his tombstone was inscribed his epitaph, written by himself:

In his will, Worsdale left money to five acknowledged bastards, as well as to a lady to give her independence from her husband.  He had, throughout his adult life, been as flamboyantly philandering as he could and had enjoyed his reputation as a rake.  Laetitia Pilkington's Memoir gives a scathing account of him, and other memoirists record him as a short, unseemly man whose whole skill was in pretence and bravado.
