# Atanasie Anghel

Anghel died in Alba Iulia on August 19, 1713, being buried near the old church of the Bălgrad Metropolitanate (built by the ruler Mihai Viteazul). Subsequently, with the construction of the Alba Carolina Citadel, the old church was demolished, and the tomb of Atanasie was moved to the cemetery near the Holy Trinity Church in Alba Iulia.

In 2013, the remains of Atanasie Anghel were moved to the Holy Trinity Cathedral, Blaj.

# George Ogilvy, 3rd Lord Banff

Ogilvy was murdered and his body consumed in a fire that destroyed Inchdrewer Castle in 1713.

His death was described in the new Statistical Accounts of Scotland of 1834–45:



.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}
It is said that he had gone for some time to Ireland, engaged probably in some of the intrigues then carrying on in behalf of the Pretender; and it was suspected that the persons in whose charge he had left the castle, having pillaged some of his valuable property, murdered him immediately after his return, and set his apartment on fire for the sake of concealment. By some, it seems, the event was viewed as a judgment on his apostacy, and particularly with regard to some threats used by him of burning the Protestants.



After Ogilvy's death his son, George, inherited the estates and succeeded to the title becoming the 4th Lord Banff in 1713.

# Christian Thomsen Carl

When Christian Thomsen Carl was in Wieck, nearby Greifswald was a front town commanded by the marquis de Saisan (actually Monsieur de Villenouvette, Comte de Saissan), a Frenchman in Saxon service. The Saxons had occupied Greifswald on 31 August 1711, and were joined by Russian forces in January 1712; tsar Peter the Great visited the town in August. Most of Swedish Pomerania was in the hand of the allies, who besieged the remaining Swedes at Stralsund.



Greifswald town fire[edit]


On 1 March at about 10:00 pm, a fire broke out in Greifswald's stables, which were used by the Saxon horse. The marquis de Saisan alleged a conspiracy of Greifswald's burghers against the occupation forces. He ordered the Greifswalders near the stables to be dislodged, and had the streets leading to the site fenced off by his troops. The situation was precarious as the town's arsenal near the fire site, holding large amounts of gunpowder, threatened to destroy much of the town when it blew up. When the fire had already encroached on the roofs of several houses, including the town hall, the marquis discarded the conspiracy theory and allowed the Greifswalders to extinguish the fire. They were however unable to do so effectively, as their fire fighting devices had been damaged by the occupation forces.

Christian Thomsen Carl decided to help, bringing with him his crewmen and fire fighting devices. Carl ordered his crew to approach Greifswald at a run from their quarters in Wieck, located about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) east of the town. While much of the town hall and 36 houses burned down, the fire was extinguished before it reached the basements containing the council's archive. The documents had been retrieved from the burning house by Carl's crewmen during the operations. Afterwards, the town awarded the crewmen an "Ohm" of brandy, containing about 150 litres (40 US gal).



Rescue of Anklam[edit]


Other Swedish Pomeranian towns were ordered by tsar Peter the Great to be systematically burned down. This order was issued on 16 March to retaliate for the burning of Danish Altona by Swedish forces under Magnus Stenbock in January. Subsequently, Gartz and Wolgast were burned down, and Anklam was to be the next town to burn. The order was to be carried out by baron von Staff, a German in Russian service, who had already burned down Wolgast on 27 March. Also on 27 March, while encamped at Friedrichsstadt in Holstein, Menshikov on his own authority revoked the tsar's order, in turn for a contribution of 1,000 reichstalers per town spared. Menshikov's decision had been preceded by the intercedings of the marquis de Saisan and king Frederik IV of Denmark. However, since the courier from Friedrichstadt would only arrive in Greifswald on 3 April, Anklam was nevertheless scheduled for destruction, and the burning of Demmin was also announced.

Staff prepared to leave for Anklam to carry out the tsar's conflagration order, but first fought a duel with Christian Thomsen Carl on 29 March on the market square in Greifswald. In the course of the duel, Staff stabbed Carl to death, perforating the right ventricle of his heart.

In most German secondary literature, it is maintained that the duel took place because Carl called Staff a "murderous incendiary" ("Mordbrenner"); while Sander (1914) says that the primary sources retrieved by him, mostly from Denmark, do not reveal the reason for the duel - he nevertheless assumes that Carl already knew about his king's efforts in rescinding the tsar's order and that his argument with Staff was about that issue. On 24 March, Christen Thomesen Sehested actually ordered Carl to intervene - because of king Frederick IV's discontent - against the devastation of Swedish Pomerania by the Russians, but without alienating them; yet, this order arrived in Greifswald only on 30 March and was answered by the Danish captain Michael Gude, who informed Sehested about the duel and Carl's death. Lützow, who reports an "exchange of words" as the reason for the duel and also notes that Staff was the one who called Carl out, further says that the duel happened directly before Carl would have left for Denmark.

The marquis de Saisan reacted by arresting Staff, charging him with murder. Thus, the burning of Anklam was delayed. However, general major Bueck, a Mecklenburger in charge of the Russian forces in Pomerania, took over the responsibility for the burning of Anklam from Staff, rescheduling it for 3 April. The inhabitants of Anklam were ordered to leave the town on 1 April, carrying with them only two shirts each and food for four days; their houses were looted and filled with straw and tar. The action was cancelled when Menshikov's courier arrived. Staff, who in 1710 participated in the successful siege of Riga, is in 1716 attested to have camped in Grevesmühlen as general major in Repnin's army. Saissan, the French mercenary who before had fought in the War of the Spanish Succession, remained in Saxon service and in 1718 led an unsuccessful attempt to abdicate Stanislaus Leszczynski; he died in Madrid in 1728 or 1739.

# Francis Cherry (non-juror)

On the death of his father Cherry took on his debts, amounting to £30,000. This brought him into serious difficulties. On one occasion he was arrested at the suit of Mrs. Barbara Porter, his godmother, for a debt of £200, and was for a few days in Reading gaol. He died on 23 September 1713 and was buried on the 25th. In accordance with his wishes his funeral was performed privately at 10 p.m. in Shottesbrooke churchyard, and on his tomb were inscribed only the words ‘Hic jacet peccatorum maximus,’ with the year of his death.

# Francis Child (died 1713)

Child was a great benefactor to Christ's Hospital, and in 1705, while president, rebuilt the ward over the east cloister at his own cost. His portrait hangs in the hall of the hospital, and another portrait exists at Osterley Park, taken in 1699 in his lord mayor's robes.

For many years he lived at Fulham, in a mansion called East End House, which he built for himself on the east side of Parson's Green. About 1711 he purchased the family seat of Osterley Park; but his son, Sir Robert Child, is said to have been the first of the family who lived there. Child died on 4 October 1713, and was buried in Fulham churchyard, where a monument was erected to his memory.

# Edmund Dummer (naval engineer)

Dummer was declared bankrupt in February 1711, and although he was released from the Fleet Prison soon afterwards he was recommitted to the Fleet in April 1712. He died there at the end of April 1713 and was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn on 8 May 1713.

After his death, the business at Sowley was bought from his creditor, the Duke of Montagu, by his brother, who ran the ironworks until 1716.

In December 1713, a petition from his widow, Sarah, and his unmarried daughter, Jane, who were close to destitution, was presented to the Navy Board. The petition was heard by Dummer's former political mentor, Robert Harley as Secretary to the Lord High Treasurer. In the light of Dummer's earlier services as a civil engineer, they were granted a pension of £150 per annum.

In August 1716, Dummer's estate, including South Stoneham manor and property at Shedfield and Curdridge, were eventually sold by Jane to meet the claims of his creditors. The manor passed to Edward Nicholas of Newton Valence.
