# Lutfunnisa Begum

Lufunnisa died in November 10 1790. She was buried in Khushbagh by the side of her husband.

# James Bowdoin

He died in Boston on November 6, 1790, of "putrid fever and dysentery". Bowdoin's funeral was one of the largest of the time in Boston, with people lining the streets to view the funeral procession.  He was interred in Boston's Granary Burying Ground.  Among his bequests was a gift to Harvard College for awards that are now known as the Bowdoin Prizes.  His son James III donated lands from the family estate in Brunswick, Maine, as well as funds and books, to establish Bowdoin College in his honor.

An orrery constructed by clockmaker Joseph Pope, now in Harvard's science department, includes bronze figures of Bowdoin and Benjamin Franklin that were supposedly cast by Paul Revere.  (Bowdoin was responsible for having the device rescued when Pope's house caught fire in 1787.)

Landmarks bearing the Bowdoin name in Boston include Bowdoin Street, Bowdoin Square, and the Bowdoin MBTA station.  Bowdoin, Maine, incorporated 1788, was named for Bowdoin; neighboring Bowdoinham, Maine (incorporated 1762) was named either for his grandfather Pierre or his brother William.

# Thomas Bradbury Chandler

Chandler died at his home in what was then known as Elizabethtown in 1790. His widow and son-in-law Elias Bailey Dayton were executors and proved his will in 1794. His body was buried in the churchyard of St. John's Episcopal Church (Elizabeth, New Jersey).

Chandler is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) alongside Rev. Samuel Johnson and Timothy Cutler on August 17. His son-in-law and grandson became bishops and are also remembered on the Episcopal church calendar: John Henry Hobart on September 12 and William Hobart Hare on May 17.

# Benjamin Franklin

Franklin suffered from obesity throughout his middle-aged and later years, which resulted in multiple health problems, particularly gout, which worsened as he aged. In poor health during the signing of the US Constitution in 1787, he was rarely seen in public from then until his death.

Benjamin Franklin died from pleuritic attack at his home in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790. He was aged 84 at the time of his death. His last words were reportedly "A dying man can do nothing easy.", to his daughter after she suggested that he change position in bed and lay on his side so he could breathe more easily. Franklin's death is described in the book The Life of Benjamin Franklin, quoting from the account of John Jones:

Approximately 20,000 people attended his funeral. He was interred in Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia. In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

Franklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads "Benjamin and Deborah Franklin".

# William Franks (died 1790)

Franks died in 1790. A memorial tablet and floorslab exists to his memory in St John the Baptist church, Kentish Town.

# William Grayson

Grayson died in Dumfries on March 12, 1790, the first member of the United States Congress to die in office. He is interred in the Grayson family vault at Belle Aire. The original mortuary vault was destroyed during the American Civil War. It was rebuilt, encased in concrete and buried by the Daughters of the American Revolution in the early 20th century.

Grayson County, Kentucky, the city of Grayson, Kentucky, and Grayson County, Virginia, were all named for the senator.

# Francis North, 1st Earl of Guilford

Lord Guilford survived his third wife by fourteen years and died in August 1790, aged 86. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, Frederick, who had previously served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1770 to 1782. His stepson Lord Dartmouth also served in government.

The Lord Guilford is the namesake of Guilford County, North Carolina.

# Lyman Hall

In 1790, Hall moved to a plantation in Burke County, Georgia, on the Carolina border, where he died on October 19 at the age of 66. Hall's widow, Mary Osborne, survived later dying in November 1793.

Lyman Hall is memorialized in Georgia where Hall County, Georgia bears his namesake; and in Connecticut, his native state, where the town of Wallingford honored him by naming a high school after its distinguished native son. Elementary schools in Liberty County, Georgia and in Hall County, Georgia are also named for him.

Signers Monument, a granite obelisk in front of the courthouse in Augusta, Georgia, memorializes Hall and the other two Georgians who signed the Declaration of Independence. His remains were re-interred there in 1848 after being exhumed from his original grave on his plantation in Burke County.

# Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh

Hardenbergh died on 30 October 1790 of tuberculosis in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  He was interred in the churchyard of the First Reformed Church in New Brunswick. The inscription on his grave was written by the Reverend John Henry Livingston and exhorts mourners to "go walk in his virtuous footsteps; and when you have finished the work assigned you, you shall rest with him in eternal peace.":p.78 It eulogises Hardenbergh as "a zealous preacher of the Gospel, and his life and conversation afforded, from his earliest days, to all who knew him, a bright example of real piety...a steady patriot, and in his public and private conduct he manifested himself to be the enemy of tyranny and oppression, the lover of freedom, and the friend of his country.":p.78 At the time of his death, Hardenbergh was a wealthy man—largely due to monies and property inherited from his father and grandfather—and was the owner of 40,000 acres of land in Ulster County that was once part of his grandfather's patent.

Hardenbergh's great-great-grandson, architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh (1847–1918) was hired by the trustees of Rutgers College to design three buildings for the campus—Geology Hall (1871–72), Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), an addition to the grammar school (now Alexander Johnston Hall)—and to design Suydam Hall (demolished) on the former campus of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, before a career designing large hotels and buildings in New York City.  In Kirkpatrick Chapel, the large stained-glass window in the chancel above the altar, titled "Jesus, the Teacher of the Ages", was donated to the college by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh after the renovation of the chapel in 1916 and dedicated to his great-great-grandfather. This window is one of four in the chapel designed and crafted in the studios of Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848–1933).

Hardenbergh Hall, a building on Rutgers University's College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey, was named in his honour. It provides classroom space in its lower floors, and undergraduate student housing for 330 students on its six upper floors. It is one of three residence halls known as the "River Halls" or "River Dorms" (the others being Frelinghuysen Hall and Campbell Hall) built in 1956 overlooking the Raritan River and located between New Brunswick's George Street and New Jersey Route 18.

# Robert H. Harrison

Harrison died at his home in Charles County on April 2, 1790.  His burial location is not known: He may have been interred at his father's Walnut Landing estate, at the Durham Parish church where his brother was rector, or at the Episcopal church cemetery in Port Tobacco.

# George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield

On 6 July 1790, Eliott died at the Schloss Kalkofen, Aachen, of palsy / stroke, allegedly brought on by drinking too much of the local mineral water, and was initially buried in the grounds of the Schloss. His personal estate was probated by 27 July and his furniture sold off by his heirs. In 1790, his body was disinterred and reburied at Heathfield, East Sussex. Later still, his body was again disinterred and reburied at St Andrew's Church, Buckland Monachorum, Devon in the church associated with his wife's Drake ancestry.

# John Howard (prison reformer)

His final journey took him into Eastern Europe, and into Crimea. Whilst at Kherson, Howard contracted typhus on a prison visit and died, aged sixty-three. He was buried in a walled field at Dophinovka (Stepanovka), Ukraine. Despite requesting a quiet funeral without pomp and ceremony, the event was elaborate and attended by the Prince of Moldovia. When news of his death reached England in February 1790, a commemorative series of John Howard halfpenny Conder Tokens were struck, including one that circulated in Bath, on the reverse showing "Go forth" and "Remember the Debtors in Gaol".

Howard became the first civilian to be honoured with a statue in St. Paul's Cathedral, London. A statue was also erected in Bedford, and a further one in Kherson. His bust features in the architecture of a number of Victorian prisons across the UK, such as at Shrewsbury. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1790.

# Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer

After the convention, Jenifer retired to his plantation at Stepney near Annapolis, where he died in 1790. He was buried at Ellerslie, the place of his birth, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places.

In his will, Jenifer passed his roughly 16,000-acre (65 km2) land holdings to his nephew, Daniel Jenifer, and instructed that all his slaves be freed six years after his death. The following year the younger Jenifer had a son, who was named after his great-uncle. Daniel Jenifer, like his uncle, also served as magistrate in Charles County, as well as three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. His family home, Retreat, was also located in Charles County, near one of the largest slave-trading ports of the era, Port Tobacco; it was built in the last quarter of the 18th century and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Jenifer Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in honor of this elder Jenifer. There is also a Jenifer Street in Washington, D.C.

# Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor

In November 1788, Joseph returned to Vienna with ruined health and was left abandoned. His minister Kaunitz refused to visit his sick-room and did not see him for two years. His brother Leopold remained at Florence. At last, Joseph, worn out and broken-hearted, recognized that his servants could not, or would not, carry out his plans. 

Joseph died on 20 February 1790. He is buried in tomb number 42 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. He asked that his epitaph read: "Here lies Joseph II, who failed in all he undertook." Joseph was succeeded by his brother, Leopold II.

# Larcum Kendall

Kendall was a first-class craftsman but not a technical designer. After K3 Kendall built chronometers to the design of John Arnold.

His home was Furnival's Inn Court, London, where he died on 22 November 1790. He was buried on 28 November in the Quaker burial ground in Kingston. His brother, Moses, had  his personal effects and the contents of his workshop auctioned by Christie's.

A blue plaque about Kendall was unveiled on 3 May 2014 in the garden of Charlbury Museum, and erected on the wall of the Post Office, close to his childhood home (since the house no longer stands).

# Thomas Lewis (Virginia)

When the Kanawha County court was established, Lewis was designated one of the twelve officers of that court, which met for the first time on October 5, 1789, at the house of George Clendenin in Charleston.

Lewis died at Lynnwood in 1790. He had become one of the largest property owners in the county. On December 19, 1794, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act which established the town of Point Pleasant at the mouth of the Kanawha River (in present-day Mason County, West Virginia) on Lewis' property.

Lewis is buried beside Jane in the Lewis Family burial ground in Rockingham County.

# Elysée Loustallot

Loustallot became seriously ill and frail in 1790.  However, he still managed to publish his last issue of the Revolutions of Paris on September 4, 1790, two weeks before his death.  His final work was a commentary on the Nancy mutiny.  He died on September 19, 1790 at the age of 28.  After learning of his death, the Jacobins sent Maximilien Robespierre and Louis Sébastien Mercier as representatives to his funeral.  The Jacobin and Cordelier clubs mourned his death for three days.

Loustallot was the main contributor of the Revolutions of Paris up until his death.  Prudhomme continued publishing the paper, with later writers Chaumette, Sylvain Maréchal, Fabre d'Eglantine, and Saintonax continuing on the journalistic standards of Loustallot. He is remembered as being a moderating voice against bloodshed, while passionately prescribing to republicanism in the early stages of Revolutionary France.

# Robert Magaw

After he was exchanged, he returned home to New Carlisle and continued his law practice. He served two years in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (1781–1782) and was for many years a trustee of Dickinson College. He died at home in Carlisle on January 7, 1790. After his death, Marritje returned to New York to live with their son, Robert Van Brunt Magaw, at Gravesend.

# Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe

Meanwhile, Thomas Metcalfe and the Fair American arrived at Kawaihae Bay, Island of Hawaiʻi, where shortly before his father Simon had flogged Chief Kameʻeiamoku and the chief had vowed revenge upon the next ship.

That next ship was the Fair American, captained by Thomas Metcalfe, the son of the very person who had so offended the chief, although nobody was aware of that fact at the time. The schooner was manned by only four sailors plus its relatively inexperienced captain. On 16 March 1790, Kameʻeiamoku's men easily captured the schooner. Thomas Metcalfe and his crew were killed. The only survivor was Isaac Davis, who was badly injured but for some reason spared. Kameʻeiamoku appropriated the ship, its guns, ammunition, and other valuable goods, as well as Isaac Davis himself. At the time no one was aware of the family relation between the captain of the Fair American and Simon Metcalfe, whose Eleanora was anchored at Kealakekua Bay, about 30 miles (50 km) away. The Fair American and Davis were eventually given to King Kamehameha I.

# Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł (1734–1790)

The death of King Augustus III in 1763 did not change Radziwiłł's obscure behaviour and addiction to alcohol, which now negatively influenced his highly successful policies and political campaigns. Furthermore, ambassador Kayserling demanded his separation from Hetman Branicki. Unlike Czartoryski, who constantly improved and participated in local councils, Radziwiłł neglected his duties, and, on the advice of one of his companions, he concluded several treaties with his closest allies, which eventually resulted in the weakening of his political party and proved to be a harm for the peasants supporting the policies issued by the Lithuanian councils under Radziwiłł's control. As a result, the election of deputies and court marshals were mostly influenced by the Czartoryskis. Radziwiłł, trying to repair his delicate and temporary reputation, travelled to Vilnius and in 1764 he established a new, illegal council and proclaimed himself marshal. The council was mostly focused on diminishing the power of Polish nobility, supportive of the Russian control over the Commonwealth, that resided in the Grand Duchy. The following day, drunk Radziwiłł broke into the home of Countess Anna Tyszkiewicz, and then to the palace of Bishop Ignacy Massalski where he insulted the royal court and humorously threatened to burn the property. The sober prince later apologized to the bishop. Having given up the duties of marshal, in March Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł left Vilnius. He later sent his militia (approx. 300 men) to defend the Polish diplomatic position at the Prussian council in Grudziądz.

On April 8, 1764 Radziwiłł married Teresa Karolina Rzewuska, the daughter of Hetman Wacław Rzewuski.

# Claude-François-Marie Rigoley

Gabriel-François de Brueys d'Aigalliers [fr] in a letter to Isabelle de Charrière dated 13 October 1790 from Paris wrote:

"This young man, one of the most obliging and amiable I know, died almost suddenly a few days ago, carrying away the regrets of all that knew him"

# Thomas Ryder (actor)

On 19 November 1790 Ryder played Old Groveby in the Maid of the Oaks. A week later (26 November 1790) he died at Sandymount, Dublin, and was buried in the churchyard of Drumcondra.

# Adam Smith

Smith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. His body was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard. On his deathbed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.

Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist Joseph Black and the pioneering geologist James Hutton. Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication. He mentioned an early unpublished History of Astronomy as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as Essays on Philosophical Subjects.

Smith's library went by his will to David Douglas, Lord Reston (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith. It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death in 1878 of her husband, the Reverend W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death, the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.

# John Stokes (North Carolina)

John Stokes served as the judge of the United States District of Western North Carolina, until his death, on October 12, 1790, less than three months, after his appointment.

# Tibbie Tamson

Few facts are known about Thomson's life. There is a local tradition that Thomson, who lived in the Kirk Wynd in Selkirk, was a poor woman of weak intellect who was treated with contempt in the town. She is said to have been accused of stealing a length of yarn, and was summoned to the sheriff court to face trial for the crime of petty theft. She took her own life and in common with others judged to have committed the crime of Felo de se her corpse was given to the burgh constable to be buried in unconsecrated ground. At this period in Scotland as in England, suicides were often given a 'profane' burial unless family or friends were able to arrange interment secretly.  Accordingly she was placed in a pauper's coffin of deal, which was dragged out of the town while her neighbours threw stones and insults, and was buried on Foulshiels Hill at the point where the Selkirk commonlands joined the estates of Bowhill and Philiphaugh. This practice of the burial of those guilty of Felo de se at the meeting of parish or estate boundaries was found elsewhere in rural Scotland, with a well-known fictional example in James Hogg's  Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1823). Amongst other points, burial within boundary areas negated the issue of a community having to get permission from a landowner.

At some point after 1790 a rough stone was placed on the grave with "I H / I THOMSON / FS 1790" or "H.L. I.T. F.S. 1790" carved on it ("Here lies Isabella Thomson for suicide [or 'Felo de se'] 1790"). Thomas Craig-Brown, in his two-volume History of Selkirkshire (1886), stated that the stone had been placed there by Michael Stewart, a dyker in the service of the Duke of Buccleuch, who "reopened the grave that he might repair the indecent haste shown at her burial. In the woman's pocket he found one penny and one farthing."

The 19th century essayist John Brown said that the "grave [was] known and feared the country round", while in more recent times it has been described as "a memorial to the worst excesses of small-town unkindness". Each year as part of their traditional perambulation of Selkirk's commons, members of the Selkirk Common Riding Organisation pass by the place and in modern times place a wreath at the grave in remembrance of her.
