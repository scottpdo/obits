# Jean Calas


On 13–14 October 1761, another of the Calas sons, Marc-Antoine, was found dead on the ground floor of the family's home. Rumors had it that Jean Calas had killed his son because he intended to convert to Catholicism. When interrogated, the family initially claimed that Marc-Antoine had been killed by a murderer. Then they declared that they had found Marc-Antoine dead, hanged; because suicide was considered a heinous crime against oneself, and the dead bodies of suicides were defiled, they had arranged for their son's suicide to look like a murder.

# Elizabeth of Russia

In the late 1750s Elizabeth's health started to decline. She began to suffer a series of dizzy spells and refused to take the prescribed medicines. She forbade the word "death" in her presence. Elizabeth suffered a stroke on Christmas Eve 1761. Knowing that she was dying, Elizabeth used her last remaining strength to make her confession, to recite with her confessor the prayer for the dying and to say farewell to those few people who wished to be with her, including Peter and Catherine and Counts Alexei and Kirill Razumovsky. The Empress died the next day, 25 December 1761. For her lying in state she was dressed in a shimmering silver dress; she was beautiful in death as she had been in life.

# Pierre Maillard

In July 1762 Maillard fell seriously ill.  On 12 August he died, attended (at his request) by Anglican clergyman Thomas Wood.  Maillard was accorded a State Funeral by the Nova Scotia Governor; his pallbearers included the Council President and the Speaker of the Assembly.  The government thus recognized his role in negotiating peace treaties between the Mi'kmaq and the British (see Burying the Hatchet Ceremony (Nova Scotia)), and his forceful personality.  He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old Burying Ground in downtown Halifax. After the St. Peter's Cemetery opened in 1784 as Halifax's first Catholic cemetery, Maillard's grave was moved to St. Peter's where it remains unmarked today under the parking lot built on top of the cemetery..

Reverend Wood wrote of Maillard:

Maillard gave all his belongings away prior to his death.  Most of his books were donated to recognized collections of the time.  His other belongings were bequeathed to Louis Petitpas, his only companion and confidential agent since 1749, and in whose home he lived while in Halifax.

# Archduchess Maria Johanna Gabriela of Austria

Maria Theresa pursued a deliberate marriage policy to which all of her children had to submit. Thus, she  married most of her children off throughout Europe. She and King Charles III of Spain agreed that Maria Theresa's fourth daughter, Archduchess Maria Amalia, would marry Charles III's son, King Ferdinand III of Sicily and IV of Naples; but Charles later wanted to break off the engagement due to Amalia being five years older than Ferdinand. Maria Theresa then turned her attention to Johanna, the closest sister who was just one year older than Ferdinand, so she betrothed Johanna to Ferdinand instead.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, smallpox was ravaging the Holy Roman Empire. Leopold Mozart, father of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, wrote that "in the whole of Vienna, nothing was spoken of except smallpox. If 10 children were on the death register, 9 of them had died from smallpox." Johanna's older brother Karl Joseph died of smallpox in 1761 and Maria Theresa became a strong supporter of inoculation, a primitive way of immunization. In order to set a strong example, the Empress ordered the inoculation of all her remaining children. Although without incidents for the other children, Johanna became ill after the inoculation and died shortly thereafter. She was buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.

# Peter III of Russia

The reign of Peter III is cast by Palmer as progressive for its focus on transforming economically developed feudal Russia to a more advanced European state. Palmer claims that his reform efforts were welcomed by society as a whole. It is Palmer's further contention that a plot against him by members of the government and influential nobles is unjustified: that the aristocratic names in the list of conspirators belonged to Guards officers, those who had lost influence and impoverished families who had no access to high government positions and were forced into service, some resentment within the Guard could not have led to a change of government. A revolt of the Guards regiments against the emperor, to whom they had sworn allegiance, could only lead to an alternative emperor. Palmer claims that the conspiracy against Peter III was carried out by Catherine and Guards officer Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov and was in fact nothing more than a murder for personal reasons. With the aid of the two Guards troops that Peter had planned to discipline more harshly, the emperor was arrested and forced to abdicate on 9 July [O.S. 28 June] 1762. Shortly thereafter, he was transported to Ropsha, where he was supposedly assassinated, although it is unknown how Peter died.

# Peter Schuyler (New Jersey)

On March 7, 1762, Schuyler died at his home, which was then called Petersborough, on the east bank of the Passaic, a short distance above Newark. As he only had one child, his entire estate passed to his daughter upon his death. She died shortly thereafter in 1765, leaving the entire estate to her husband, Archibald Kennedy, Earl of Casselis, who remarried in 1769 to Anne Watts (1744–1783), the sister of John Watts (1749–1836), both of whom were descendants of the Schuyler family.

# Thomas Smith (Royal Navy officer)

# Luis Vicente de Velasco

During the Seven Years' War the British sent an expedition against Cuba in 1762 with a fleet of 23 ships, 24 frigates and 150 transport and support ships, carrying an invasion army of 14,000 men, later reinforced by another 4,000 men, under command of Admiral George Pocock. 10,000 men embarked under command of George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle and conquered the heights, which the governor of Cuba, Juan de Prado had left undefended.

Velasco defended the vital Morro Castle with 64 heavy guns and a garrison of 700 men. On July 1, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: HMS Stirling Castle, HMS Dragon, HMS Marlborough and HMS Cambridge. The naval and land artilleries simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high. Counter-fire from 30 guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and serious damage to the four ships of the line, forcing them to withdraw.

The fortress held out for another two months despite daily heavy shelling, thanks to the energetic and valiant leadership of Velasco.
The resistance came to an end when Velasco was hit by a bullet in the chest. The leader of the British attack force, Sir Reppel, allowed the transfer of the heavily wounded Velasco to Havana, where British surgeons tried to save his life, but in vain; he died on July 31, 1762. The British and Spanish concluded a truce to allow for his burial.

Two weeks later, Havana fell into British hands.
