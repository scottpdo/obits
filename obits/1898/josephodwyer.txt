Joseph O'Dwyer



W.P. Northrup wrote, "Intubation is O'Dwyer's monument. It is equally true that it killed him." By this Northrup refers to the fact that others rushed to adopt the still developing technique, resulting in a variety of negative results due in large part to their own inexperience. Correspondence from these untrained practitioners caused O'Dwyer a great deal of stress. "All the unhappy results all tales of misadventure, and all the unfavorable criticisms came directly to him." Still grieving his late wife, O'Dwyer worried much and slept little.

In December 1897 he developed symptoms of a diphtheria-related myocardiopathy, likely contracted while treating a young patient. He died on January 7, 1898. O'Dwyer did not make much money from the development of his intubation method and according to his friend Northrup, "died poor". The trustees of Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons established the O'Dwyer Scholarship to provide for the education of his son and namesake, which then was allowed to lapse upon Joseph Jr.'s graduation. Family friends arranged for the education of his three other sons.
