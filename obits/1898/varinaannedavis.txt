Varina Anne Davis



In July 1898, Winnie Davis became deathly ill. She had been soaked in a rainstorm at a Confederate Veterans' Reunion in Atlanta, Georgia, then traveled by train to meet her mother in Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island. They vacationed there annually in the summer at the fashionable Rockingham Hotel. Doctors diagnosed Davis with "malarial gastritis."[page needed] She had already suffered for years from gastritis. (It has been associated with bacterial infection.) Davis suffered for weeks from fever, chills, and loss of appetite. The Rockingham Hotel closed for the season in early September, but the management allowed Davis and her mother to stay on. Davis died there on September 18, 1898. She was 34 years old.

Her mother arranged for her daughter to be buried in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery, with military honors because of her service to Confederate veterans' groups. She was next to the graves of her father and brothers, who had been reinterred here.[page needed]

Davis was survived by her mother Varina and by her sister Margaret (Davis) Addison Hayes, then living in Colorado Springs, Colorado with her husband Joel Addison Hayes, and her sister's children. Among their several children was a daughter, Varina Howell Davis Hayes. The youngest Varina later married Gerald Bertram Webb. Among their children was a daughter, Varina Margaret Webb.
