Aubrey Beardsley



In December 1896 Beardsley suffered a violent hemorrhage leaving him in precarious health. By April 1897, a month after his conversion to Roman Catholicism, his deteriorating health prompted a move to the French Riviera. There he died a year later on 16 March 1898 of tuberculosis at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Menton, France, attended by his mother and sister. He was 25 years old. Following a Requiem Mass in Menton Cathedral the following day, his remains were interred in the Cimetiere du Trabuquet.
