Heungseon Daewongun



In 1895, Japanese officials in Korea were plotting the removal of Gojong's wife, Queen Min. Miura Gor≈ç, Inoue Kaoru's successor as Japanese advisor to the Korean government, and Sugimura Fukashi, a secretary of the Japanese legation, planned the attempt. The two decided to involve the Daewongun in the plot, and after making inquiries, learned that he was "indignant enough to plan a coup" and would cooperate with them. On 8 October 1895, early in the morning, Japanese policemen escorted the Daewongun to the palace.  His involvement from that point on is unclear, but on that morning, Japanese agents assassinated Queen Min.
