Ebenezer Skellie



Four years after the death of his only child, Ebenezer Skellie also passed away. Reportedly, as he lay dying at his home at Findley Lake on July 2, 1898, his final words were: "I see Minnie. Move my chair down a little closer to the edge of the river, so I can step over." He was then laid to rest at the same cemetery where his two children and parents were interred.
