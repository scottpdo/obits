William Hickley Gross



After falling ill while giving a retreat for Redemptorist students in Annapolis, he died shortly afterwards at St. Joseph's Hospital in Baltimore, aged 61. He was buried at Most Holy Redeemer Cemetery in Baltimore. His eloquence had led him to become known as "the silver tongued orator of the hierarchy."
