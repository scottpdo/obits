Próspero Morales



See also: Manuel Estrada Cabrera


After the September Quetzaltenango Revolution of 1897 failed, Morales and Górriz fled Guatemala and moved into Tapachula, México where he learned that former Secretary of the Interior Manuel Estrada Cabrera had been appointed as interim president after Reina Barrios was murdered on 8 February 1898, Próspero Morales made the decision to be a presidential candidate in the 1898 elections. However, when he realized that Estrada Cabrera was using his position to ridge the elections, Morales went to México City to recruit people for an invasion to Guatemala. Back in Tapachula we received support from colonels Rodrigo Castilla and Víctor López, who lived on the Guatemalan side of the border, in San Marcos–where Morales was born. On 22 July 1898, approximately 1500 rebels entered Guatemala from Mexico equipped with Mauser rifles to end Estrada Cabrera regime, but their adventure was swiftly neutralized, as Estrada Cabrera sent twelve thousand troops to stop them, declared Martial Law and secured the help of a British navy ship to attack the Port of Ocós if needed. The commander in chief of the Guatemalan Army was former president Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, who defeated the rebels in Vado Ancho on 5 August of that year. After the invasion failure, Morales followers split; some of them went back to Mexico while a few stayed with him, until he surrendered on 14 August. He eventually died on 17 August.
