Nils Tjoflot



Tjoflot died in a shipwreck in 1898 when he was only 32 years old. On Sunday, July 10, 1898, he traveled with his custom-built sailboat to Granvin. He was frequently in Granvin, where he had many friends and acquaintances from his confirmation, including many that played fiddle. Both Severin Kjerland and Nils Nilsson Eida were admirers of Nils. This Sunday there were two men with him in the boat, Endre Sjurson Kvammen and Jon Tjoflot. In Granvin, Nils Tjoflot played at a barn dance, and the dance lasted until late in the night.

It was already morning when the three had to travel back on the sailboat to Tjoflot. Nils sat in the bow with his fiddle and Endre was at the helm. Nils is reported to have stated, "We're sailing under the Norwegian flag." He played the folk dance tune "Blåmannen," which he had learned from Håstabø. Soon they were far out in the fjord, and the music could no longer heard by those on the land. Suddenly, they turned against the wind so that the boat was sailing close-hauled near Røynstrand. The boat went over and took on water. It had heavy ballast, stone covered with a latticework, and it sank in the blink of an eye. It all happened so fast that no one on land fully understood what had happened. People quickly rowed out to the scene, but there was nothing to see when they arrived. Soon afterward, Nils's fiddle and hat floated up, and that was all. This caused much sadness because Nils was a popular man known for his hard work, artistic sense, and forthrightness.
