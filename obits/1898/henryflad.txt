Henry Flad



His death occurred June 20, 1898, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he stopped on his way home from a meeting of the Mississippi River Commission to visit Mr Godfrey Stengel, a lifelong friend who had come with him on the same ship to America forty nine years before. He died very suddenly of acute heart failure while walking to Highland park in company with Mr and Mrs Stengel. Up to the last moment he was in excellent spirits and died without pain as without fear.
