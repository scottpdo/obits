Slomon remarried for a final time to Eliza Pearson, the daughter of a Confederate Captain named John William Pearson in 1870. Pearson died in the Civil War when he was leading Company B of the Ninth Infantry Florida, then part of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, through a cornfield at the Battle of Globe Tavern. Eliza Pearson graduated from Columbia College in 1865 majoring in French and Music. After Eliza graduated she moved back to her hometown just before the burning of Columbia by William Tecumseh Sherman's Union forces on February 17, 1865. John's hometown, and Eliza's, was Orange Springs, Florida only 30 miles north of Ocala. In 1873 Eliza gave birth to her first son named John Pearson Moody named after her father. In 1877 Eliza gave birth to Slomon Moody who became a Private in the Spanish–American War. In 1883 Eliza had Maxey Dell Moody who would establish his own business called M. D. Moody in 1913. Maxey's business would stay in operation for 100 years as the oldest family owned construction equipment distributor in the United States under Maxey Dell Moody Jr. and Maxey Dell Moody III.

Around 1874 Slomon became ill and gradually ceased his practice due to his illness. He then transitioned to a successful orange farmer. He cultivated and experimented with oranges leading him to become a reputable authority figure on oranges. In December 1885 Slomon shipped a crate of oranges to John Clayton in Liverpool, England. Slomon decided to invest all of his savings in orange cultivation which then ruined him when the Great Freeze of 1894–1895 destroyed much of the citrus crop of Florida. Financially ruined he returned to his practice but by January 11, 1898 Sloman became very ill. On March 20, 1898 Sloman dies in Ocala leaving behind twelve children.
