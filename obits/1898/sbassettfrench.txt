S. Bassett French



French died on April 25, 1898. He was buried in Manchester's Maury cemetery, which is now within Richmond's expanded city limits. In 1949 the Library of Virginia published a microform containing his biographical sketches of notable Virginians that French had been editing into a book, and continues to hold them in its collection. The Swem library at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg also has some of French's papers, chiefly correspondence to him concerning those biographies. In 1964, Glenn C. Oldaker compiled and published S. Bassett French's memoirs.
