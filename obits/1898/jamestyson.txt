James Tyson



Slow of speech, though astute and perceptive, "Jimmy" Tyson habitually dressed like a tradesman or boundary rider, and when he visited his various properties, he did so anonymously, preferring the swagmen's camp and the company of sundowners to the comfort of the manager's homestead.

Tyson travelled much about Australia, but eventually made his principal home at Felton station on the Darling Downs. He died there on 4 December 1898. He had been ailing for two weeks but refused to see a doctor. His funeral service was held at St James's Church at Toowoomba and he was buried in Toowoomba Cemetery.

At the time of his death his estate was the largest in Australia to that time.  However he died unmarried, childless and intestate.  His estate was sold off, realising about Â£2.36 million, which was divided among his closest relatives. In 1901, his remains were exhumed and re-buried in a family vault at St Peter's Anglican Church in Campbelltown, New South Wales;
