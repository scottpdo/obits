Caroline Miskel Hoyt



On October 1, 1898, Caroline Miskel Hoyt, who had become acutely ill with kidney problems, became gravely ill following the birth of her baby son. Both died the next day, and mother and son were interred together at the Hoyt family plot in Charlestown, New Hampshire. The loss brought about the decline of Charles Hoyt, leading to his death in November 1900.
