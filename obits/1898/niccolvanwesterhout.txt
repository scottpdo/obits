Niccolò van Westerhout



Westerhout died in Naples. Because of indigence besetting the family, the City of Naples paid for funeral and burial in the monumental Cemetery of Poggioreale.

After the death of Niccolò, his friends and his brother Vincent tried to offer his music compositions to various publishers but they were unable to bear the costs necessary for its distribution and his music was soon forgotten.

Recently, the tomb that housed the remains of the composer and some of his relatives has been identified at the Congregation of St. Raphael a Mater Dei. On 19 February 2007, the 150th anniversary of the birth, the bones were then transported to the city that gave him birth.

In Mola di Bari, the composer had been commemorated with the naming of a street and the municipal theater and the placing of a plaque at the site of the birthplace. Furthermore, in the central Piazza XX Settembre, a bronze statue by Molese sculptor Bruno Calvani, representing the protagonist of the Doña Flor, was placed. Lately, his remains were returned to Mola and now rest in the family tomb of the De Stasi family in the local cemetery
