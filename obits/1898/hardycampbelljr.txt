Hardy Campbell Jr.



In early June 1898, the then thirty-four-year Campbell fell ill with pneumonia. A husband and father of two, he died two weeks later on June 24. In their obituary, the New York Times called him "an excellent judge of horses" and that it was "due in a great measure to his ability as a trainer that M. F. Dwyer was so successful with his horses."

A few months later his despondent sixty-year-old father, further distressed by a disagreement over a horse with a grandson, attempted suicide.
