Frank H. Reid



On the evening of July 8, 1898, he was assigned to guard the entrance of Juneau Wharf, along with Josias Martin Tanner, Jesse Murphy and John Landers, to keep Soapy Smith and his men from entering a meeting being held by the 101 at the opposite end of the wharf. Smith arrived at the scene and assaulted Reid, which started what is historically known as the Shootout on Juneau Wharf. Smith died at the scene, while Reid lay wounded in the hospital for 12 days before dying on July 20, 1898.
