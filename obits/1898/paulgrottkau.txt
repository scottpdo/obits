Paul Grottkau



In the spring of 1898, Grottkau made a speaking tour on behalf of the Social Democracy, visiting the cities of Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit. During this trip Grottkau contracted pneumonia, which led to his hospitalization at St. Joseph's Hospital in Milwaukee on May 30. Grottkau's condition continued to deteriorate and he succumbed to the effects of the illness in the evening of June 3, 1898.

A funeral was held in Milwaukee on June 5, 1898, which was addressed by Victor L. Berger in German as well as by other prominent Milwaukee labor and political leaders. Grottkau's body was interred at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.
