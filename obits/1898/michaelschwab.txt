Michael Schwab



Schwab was troubled by "intestinal and pulmonary troubles" during his last several years, for which he was hospitalized at the Alexian Brothers' Hospital in Chicago for the same on November 12, 1897. He would remain hospitalized for the last seven months of his life, undergoing an operation in the middle of May 1898 in a vain effort to reverse his fate. Schwab expired from his chronic internal ailment at 3:30 am on the morning of June 29, 1898. He was 44 years old at the time of his death.

Arrangements for Schwab's funeral were handled by the Social Turnverein of Chicago, which announced plans for the cremation of Schwab's body immediately after his death at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. Schwab was cremated the morning of July 6, with his ashes turned over to his widow for disposition at her pleasure.

A memorial to Schwab was erected at Waldheim Cemetery where it stands along headstones of other Haymarket martyrs.
