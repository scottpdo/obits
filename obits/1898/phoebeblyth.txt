Phoebe Blyth



Blyth passed away at her home, 27 Mansion House Road, in Edinburgh on 12 February 1898. She was buried at Grange Cemetery three days later. Her will left a trust of three hundred pounds a year to the support of “such indigent and infirm gentlewomen”, the recipients to be decided upon by female members of her extensive family. A portion of her estate was to be donated to hospitals, missions, asylums and sick societies in Edinburgh.
