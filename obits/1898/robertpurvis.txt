Robert Purvis



Neither of Purvis' elder sons survived the American Civil War. Both William P. Purvis (1832 - 1857) and Robert Purvis (1834 - 1862) were buried in the Byberry burial ground in North East Philadelphia, now adjacent to Benjamin Rush State Park and a warehouse of the U.S. National Archives. When the burial ground of St. Thomas African Episcopal Church, where his mother had been buried in central Philadelphia was closed, Purvis had the remains transferred to Fair Hill Burial Ground in Philadelphia's Germantown neighborhood, where his wife (1810-1875) and daughter Georgianna (1848-1877) who had died of consumption were buried, and where he himself would be buried in 1898.

His abolitionist efforts are now remembered by the state of Pennsylvania, and by the National Park Service.
