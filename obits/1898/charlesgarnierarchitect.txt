Charles Garnier (architect)



Garnier retired from his private architectural practice in 1896, but continued to serve on juries for architectural competitions and to appear at official functions. He suffered a stroke at 4 o'clock in the morning on 2 August 1898, while at home in Paris, and a second the following evening, dying at 8 o'clock in the evening. He was interred in the Montparnasse cemetery. After his death a public monument, completed in 1902 to designs by Jean-Louis Pascal and crowned with a copy of the bust of Garnier, which had been created by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux in 1869, was erected west of the Rotonde de l'Empereur of the Palais Garnier.
