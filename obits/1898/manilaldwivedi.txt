In his autobiography, Manilal states that he visited a brothel in the second term of the first year of college, and again a year later. As a result of one of these visits he contracted syphilis. This developed into secondary and then tertiary syphilis. Manilal records an abscess on his neck in July 1898. In September, he developed jaundice and pleurisy. He died on the morning of 1 October 1898, while lying on his stomach and writing at his home in Nadiad, in the presence of friends.
