Harris M. Plaisted



From 1884 to 1898 Plaisted was editor and publisher of the New Age, a newspaper in Augusta.  He used its editorial pages to convey his political views, and engaged in long-running debates with Republicans over their monetary policy, primarily Maine party leader James G. Blaine.

In his later years, Plaisted suffered from Bright's disease.  He died in Bangor on January 31, 1898, and was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor.
