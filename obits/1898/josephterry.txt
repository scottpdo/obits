Joseph Terry



Terry died of heart failure, induced by over-exertion, at the Royal Station Hotel on 12 January 1898, after attempting to win a by-election to become Member of Parliament for the City of York. The by-election was triggered by the death of incumbent Queen's Counsel and former Solicitor General Sir Frank Lockwood on 18 December 1897. If successful, he would have served as second member to John Butcher (later the 1st Baron Danesfort), whom he respected for his work within the constituency. Terry died one day before the announcement of the new member was made, and the election was eventually won by famed admiral and veteran MP Lord Charles Beresford by a mere eleven votes, in a controversial recount forced by a Parliamentary petition after he and Liberal candidate Sir Christopher Furness had both obtained 5,643 votes according to initial data. Terry was buried at the York Cemetery on 15 January 1898, where his monument comprised a large granite cross and a small apron of ground.
