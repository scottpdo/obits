Sophia Braeunlich



Braeunlich died in New York City, on August 11, 1898.

The Sophia Fund, incorporated in May, 1900, was organized by Rothwell as a memorial to Braeunlich. The object of the fund was to "remove friendless little girls from dangerous and demoralizing surroundings and place them in desirable private families, and where possible to have them adopted". The fund started with a donation of about US$25,000, a part of which was contributed from moneys left by Braeunlich.
