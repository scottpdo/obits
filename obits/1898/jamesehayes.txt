James E. Hayes



Hayes was brought to Boston City Hospital on February 3, 1898 after an accident caused a rupture. His condition was severe and an operation was needed. On February 8, 1898 Hayes died from complications caused from peritonitis. His funeral was held Friday, February 10, 1898< at St. Francis de Sales in Charlestown, and was attended by 1,500 Knights.  A large number of clergy, nearly every member of the Senate, delegations from the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Massachusetts Governor's Council, and numerous other political figures attended. Thousands of people stood outside the church, unable to find space inside.

A memorial service was held on March 6, 1898, at St. Margaret's Church in Dorchester, Massachusetts.  Numerous other services were held around the city of Boston and around the country in his honor.  Hayes, a bachelor, was buried in St. Paul's Cemetery in Arlington, Massachusetts.

His death, one history noted "deprived the Order of a leader whose career had been so admirable that it gave the promise of remarkable fruition."  In honor of him, the Knights established a scholarship in his honor at Boston College.  The Boston Globe, in a front page obituary, eulogized him by saying his death "removes from the ranks of political life one of the foremost young orators and leaders of the democratic party in Massachusetts, and one of the most promising members of the Massachusetts legislature."
