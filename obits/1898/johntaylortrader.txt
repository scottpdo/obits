John Taylor (trader)



John Taylor moved from Freetown and established a store in Port Loko, Sierra Leone. Taylor was killed by Temne "war boys" mustered by Bai Bureh during the Hut Tax War in 1898. The war boys found Taylor by releasing his pet monkey, which ran upstairs and revealed where he was hiding in his house. Taylor's throat was then cut and he was chopped to pieces by the war boys. Taylor was killed because Bai Bureh's men believed he supported the British in their "hut tax" on all houses. Taylor was also accused of spying and providing information to District Commissioner Sharpe regarding the movement of Bai Bureh's men.
