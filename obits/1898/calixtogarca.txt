Calixto García



García died of pneumonia at age 59 on December 11, 1898, while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. He was buried temporarily in Arlington National Cemetery in the U.S., then transported on the heavily armed seagoing war ship USS Nashville to Cuba. His final burial in Cuba was preceded by a number of emotional incidents, and his statues and busts are found throughout Cuba. A major statue is found on the Malecon near the US Interests Section in Havana. After his death, a large bronze tablet prominently inscribed with the phrase "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" was erected by the Masons at the place of his demise—the Raleigh Hotel in Washington, D.C. Today, this tablet resides at the private residence of one of Gen. García's direct descendants.

The essay "A Message to Garcia" by Elbert Hubbard was written in reference to U.S. intelligence officer Andrew Rowan's successful mission, against great odds, to establish contact with García early in the Spanish–American War. According to language expert Charles Earle Funk, "to take a message to Garcia", meaning to accept an extremely difficult challenge, was a popular U.S. slang expression for years. The essay was made into two American films, the 1916 silent A Message to Garcia with Garcia played by Charles Sutton and the 1936 film A Message to Garcia featuring Enrique Acosta.

In 1976 a municipality in Holguín Province was named Calixto Garcia for him. His portrait is on the 50 Cuban peso banknote.
