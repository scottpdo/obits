Reg Birkett



Reginald married Lizette Crunden in 1881 in Cuckfield, West Sussex. They had at least two sons, Gerald (born 1883) and John (who would later captain the England rugby union side) (born 1884). A skin and fur broker by profession, he died at his Wimbledon home following an accident; whilst suffering from diphtheria, he leapt from a window while being helped into his bed and fell 20 feet to his death - at the inquest, a verdict of suicide whilst delirious was returned.
