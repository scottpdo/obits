George Friend (parliamentary official)



Friend died at his home in Thorndon at about 9am on 19 July 1898. The cause of death was reported as being "a glandular swelling, which developed into a painful tumour". Obituaries and reports of his large funeral were published in numerous newspapers.

Members paid tribute to Friend when his death was announced in the House that afternoon, Speaker Sir Maurice O'Rorke stating: "He was a most zealous and painstaking officer, and I could always rely with the fullest confidence upon the accuracy with which his work was performed". The House agreed a motion proposed by Premier Richard Seddon: "to record its high sense of the faithful services rendered to the House of Representatives during thirty-five years by the late Mr George Friend, as Clerk-Assistant and Clerk of the House of Representatives". As a mark of respect the House then adjourned without dealing with any further business. Friend's widow and daughter received a compassionate grant from the government of 900 pounds (about a year's salary).

Friend is buried at Karori (St Mary's) Churchyard.
