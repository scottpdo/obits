Jim Baker (frontiersman)



In 1859, Baker took up a homestead near Denver, three miles north on Clear Creek. In 1864, he built an adobe brick building at what is now 53rd and Tennyson Streets, just west of the campus of Regis University. Baker built a toll bridge and owned the first coal mine in Colorado, where Ris is now, 18Â miles west of Denver. In the same year, Baker was appointed a captain in the Colorado Militia along with John Chivington, who later lead the Colorado Territorial forces in the infamous Sand Creek Massacre.

In 1873, Baker left Colorado and bought a ranch near Savery, Wyoming. He built a cabin from cotton wood trees, with his three daughters, Isabel, Madeline, and Jennie. The cabin had three stories. The upper was used as a watch tower, but as the likelihood of conflict with Native Americans reduced the third story was removed.

1875, Baker served under General George Custer as a scout during the Battle of the Rosebud, in the Black Hills. In 1881 he was asked to scout in another battle, the Meeker Massacre, led by General Thornburg.

In May 15, 1898, Baker died in his cabin near Savery, Carbon County, Wyoming. He was known as "Honest Jim Baker". His body was buried in a small cemetery overlooking the Little Snake River Valley.

In 1917, the Baker Cabin was removed from Savery and taken to Frontier Park in Cheyenne, Wyoming. In July 1976, the home of Jim Baker was returned to Savery, Wyoming and is now located at the Little Snake River Museum. The cabin was reconstructed under the direction of Jim Baker's great-grandson, Paul McAllister, who still lives in Dixon, Wyoming.
