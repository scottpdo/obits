Laura Smith Haviland



During her life, Laura Haviland not only combated slavery and worked to improve the living conditions of Freedmen, she was also actively involved in other social causes, advocating for women's suffrage, and helping to organize the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Michigan.

Laura Haviland died on April 20, 1898 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at the home of her brother, Samuel Smith. She is buried next to her husband in the Raisin Valley Cemetery in Adrian, Michigan.

Symbolically, at Haviland's funeral, hymns were sung by a choir of white and African American singers, and then her casket was carried to the grave by a group white and African American pall-bearers.

In recognition of her efforts, the town of Haviland, Kansas was named in her honor. A statue of Laura Haviland stands in front of the Lenawee County Historical Museum in Adrian, Michigan. The inscription on the statue reads:



A Tribute to a Life Consecrated to the Betterment of Humanity.


Laura Smith Haviland Elementary School in Waterford, Michigan is named in her honor.
