In February 1795 he became professor of fortification at the École centrale des travaux publics, where he presented it as a combination of other sciences with important economic and political implications. Printed by order of the government, his last work was  Considérations militaires et politiques sur les fortifications, summarizing all his previous work.

He was appointed to the Sénat conservateur in 1799 by Bonaparte during the latter's time as First Consul, but died at the château de la Tuilerie in Auteuil [fr] aged 67 the following year. Until his death he was a non-resident member of the geography section of the Institut de France. One of the Lunettes of Trois-Châtels and Tousey was named after him, whilst his daughter Élisabeth le Michaud d'Arcon de Vaudey was a lady in waiting to empress Josephine and mistress to Napoleon I.

# Sam Arnull

Barrington never married, and lived for most of his life in chambers in King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple, London. He was afflicted by a paralysis from his legs upward and died after being bedridden for long on 14 March 1800, and his remains were interred into the vault of the Temple Church.

# Francisco Bouligny

Bouligny died in New Orleans on 25 November 1800 following a long illness. He was honored by being buried in St. Louis Cathedral. In September 1800, the Spanish Crown appointed Bouligny brigadier general, but the written copy of the commission did not reach Louisiana until after his death.

Bouligny left behind what was considered an extensive library of 148 books, a wine cellar holding some 500 bottles of wine, and 31 slaves.

# Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet

In the late 1790s Buller was in poor health, suffering from frequent attacks of gout and other ailments. He died during the night of 4/5 June 1800 after suffering an acute breakdown in his health during a game of piquet at his house in Bedford Square in  London, shortly before had intended to resign his legal position.[clarification needed] He was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Church, Holborn, City of London, near Gray's Inn. A mural monument to him survives in the Yarde-Buller Chapel, north transept of St Mary's Church, Brixham, the parish church of Lupton House, inscribed in Latin as follows:

which may be translated as:

Sculpted below in low relief is a sword of justice crossed by a beam of a set of scales of justice. At top is shown a shield of the Buller arms with inescutcheon of pretence of Yarde (of 4 quarters) for his heiress wife Susanna Yarde.

# Henry Cort

When Adam Jellicoe died suddenly on 30 August 1789, it became apparent that the £58 000 lent to Cort could not be repaid. As a result, the Crown seized all the Property of Adam Jellicoe as well as that of the partnership of Cort and Samuel Jellicoe. Cort was held responsible for Jellicoe's debt and declared bankrupt. The Crown later gave Samuel Jellicoe possession of the works at Fontley where he " remained ... undisturbed for long years afterward" and made no attempt to realize patent dues from ironmasters, as the system did not work with the grey iron produced in the Midlands and South Wales.

# Francisco Dagohoy

Francisco Dagohoy died in 1800 at Talibon, Bohol. He did not die because of his staunch opposition of the Spaniards, but rather, peacefully from old age and sickness.

# Johann Christian Dieterich

Dieterich died in Göttingen.  His son Heinrich (1761-1837) continued running the business himself until 1824.

# Thomas Dimsdale

He lived in Bengeo, Hertfordshire. and died in 1800. He was buried in the Quakers' burial-ground at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire.

# Isaac Doolittle

Doolittle's health failed in 1785 and he suspended business activity for several years, but in January 1788 he announced in a newspaper advertisement his return to health and business in his reopened shop. There is a humorous anecdote by the well-known New Haven physician Eneas Munson, a man known not only as a scientific doctor but for his droll comments at the expense even of his intimate friends, that may illuminate something of Doolittle's irascible character in this period. According to the account of Henry Bronson:

Doolittle continued to make clocks and cast bells until 1797, when his health failed again and he largely retired from business. He died on February 13, 1800 at age 78, according to his obituary, "after a long and distressing illness of several years", honored as "a very worthy and respectable character". He was buried on the Green in New Haven near the State House; there is an empty space apparently reserved for his stone at Grove Street Cemetery next to his co-warden Enos Alling, but his stone was either lost, broken, or not transferred when the other stones from people buried on the Green were moved to Grove Street Cemetery in 1821 – though his daughter Mary's stone can be found along the west wall there. His wife Sarah, born on January 30, 1725, in New Haven, Connecticut, died on March 10, 1814 in New Haven and is buried in Center Street Cemetery, Wallingford, Connecticut.

# Aaron Hart (businessman)

Hart died at Trois-Rivières on December 28, 1800, at the age of 76. At his death he was reputed to be the wealthiest man in British Canada.

He was survived by his wife Dorothea Catherine and four sons: Moses, Ezekiel, Benjamin, and Alexander, and four daughters: Catharine, Charlotte, Elizabeth, and Sarah.

A number of his descendants settled in New York, where they became members of the Congregation Shearith Israel. Most of Aaron Hart's children and grandchildren had remained Jews, and despite speculation to the contrary, many of Aaron Hart's descendants continue to live in the Jewish faith to this day.[citation needed]

His second son, Ezekiel Hart, who entered into the family business at Trois-Rivières and later opened a brewery with his brothers, was elected to the legislative assembly.  Later he was expelled from his seat because he was a Jew.[citation needed] His son Moses became a businessman at William-Henry (later Sorel) and ran unsuccessfully several times for a seat in the legislative assembly. His son Benjamin became an important businessman in Montreal.

# Ravivarma Narasimha Domba Heggade

Ravivarma was born in a royal dynasty known as Domba Heggade who ruled the Vitla principality which roughly comprised the southern talukas of the present Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka, India. He succeeded his maternal uncle Achyuta Domba Heggade to the throne according to the matrilineal inheritance laws of the  to which the dynasty belonged. Ravivarma succeeded the throne in turbulent times as Achuyta Heggade was beheaded by Hyder Ali, the Muslim Ruler of Mysore after being captured in a conquest campaign. The royal family had fled to Tellicherry in present day Kerala during Hyder Ali's campaign and hence survived. 

After few years in exile, Ravivarma led a military campaign to reclaim his kingdom and was successful. He was helped by the Raja of Nileshwaram and the British. But later on when the British tried to reduce the influence of the Domba heggade dynasty, Ravivarma openly revolted against their presence in south Canara district along with the neighbouring Raja of Kumbla and Raja Of Nileshwaram. The three principalities led a combined revolt against the British but were unsuccessful and defeated. Ravivarma was hanged along with 9 members of the domba heggade dynasty by the British after they gained complete control of south Canara region on 22 August 1800.

# Benjamin Huntington

# Jeongjo of Joseon

In his last years, he prepared for the marriage for his second son Sunjo of Joseons, three times decision and choice to Lady Kim of Ahndong clan, one daughter of Kim Cho-sun but he did not live to see his son's marriage.

King Jeongjo was known as an innovative person despite his high political status in Joseon.  In 1800, he died suddenly under mysterious circumstances at the age of 47, without seeing his lifelong wishes that were later realized by his son, Sunjo. There are many books regarding the mysterious death of Jeongjo, and speculation as to the cause of his death continues even today.

He is buried with his wife, Queen Hyoui, at the royal tomb of Geolleung (건릉, 健陵) in the city of Hwaseong.

# Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch, 7th Baronet

Kinloch went to live with Farquharson at his house at Worlds End Close on the Royal Mile. Farquharson disappears from the Edinburgh Post Office Directory soon thereafter, presumably choosing a less urban environment for this onerous task of caring for Kinloch.

Archibald died in 1800, presumably in  Farquharson's house (given the requirements of the judgement). At this point, his younger brother, Sir Alexander Kinloch (Sandie) became the 8th baronet and the Kinloch baronetcy returned to normality.

# William Locker (Royal Navy officer)

In 1770 William married Lucy, the daughter of Admiral William Parry and the granddaughter of Commodore Charles Brown.  Before her death in 1780, the two would have two daughters, Lucy and Elizabeth, and three sons, William, John, and Edward Hawke.  The family had interests in Addington Kent, and a farm at Gillingham.

William Locker died at Greenwich Hospital on 26 December 1800.  The following day Nelson wrote a letter of condolence to his eldest son, John: "The greatest consolation to us, his friends that remain, is that he has left a character for honour and honesty which none of us can surpass and very few attain." He was buried in the family vault at Addington where he had previously erected a memorial to his wife.

# Rawlins Lowndes

Lowndes died in Charleston, South Carolina, on August 24, 1800, and was buried in St. Philip's cemetery.

# Roddy McCorley

After McCorley was arrested he was tried by court martial in Ballymena on 20 February 1800 and sentenced to be hanged "near the Bridge of Toome", in the parish of Duneane. His execution occurred on 28 February 1800. This bridge had been partially destroyed by rebels in 1798 to prevent the arrival of loyalist reinforcements from west of the River Bann.

His body was then dismembered and buried under the gallows, on the main Antrim to Derry road. A letter published in the Belfast Newsletter a few days after McCorley's execution gave an account of the execution and how McCorley was viewed by some. In it he is called Roger McCorley, which may be his proper Christian name.

In 1852, McCorley's alleged nephew Hugh McCorley was appointed foreman of construction of a new bridge across the River Bann at Toome. Hugh made plans to recover his uncle's body and on 29 June 1852, buried him in an unmarked grave at Duneane parish graveyard.

His alleged great-grandson, Roger McCorley, was an officer in the Irish Republican Army in the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921).

# Thomas Mifflin

Mifflin died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania on January 23, 1800. He is interred at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Lancaster.

It reads: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}

# Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill

On May 17, 1773, a Coroner's Inquest produced a verdict that Abraham Morris and the party of soldiers were guilty of the wilful and wanton Murder of Art Ó Laoghaire.

On July 17, 1773, O'Leary's brother Cornelius attempted to murder Abraham Morris, then fled to America. Morris recovered from the shots, but they were considered to have shortened his life. (He died in September 1775.)

On September 4, 1773, Morris submitted himself to trial by his peers, the local Magistracy, and was found innocent of any crime by those Gentlemen. Green, who fired the fatal shot, was later decorated for gallantry.

# John Patten (American politician)

Patten died at his home, Tynhead Court, near Dover, and is buried in the Old Presbyterian Cemetery, which is at Dover, on the grounds of the Delaware State Museum. He had a home on the north side of Front Street, between Orange and Tatnall Streets in Wilmington, Delaware, but was always a legal resident of Kent County. He was active in the Philadelphia Society for promoting Agriculture, the Society of the Cincinnati, and the Lyceum of Delaware.

# Mary Robinson (poet)

Mary Robinson, who now lived separately from her husband, went on to have several love affairs, most notably with Banastre Tarleton, a soldier who had recently distinguished himself fighting in the American War of Independence. Prior to their relationship beginning, Robinson had been having an affair with a man named Lord Malden. According to one account, Malden and Tarleton were betting men, and Malden was so confident in Robinson’s loyalty to him, and believed that no man could ever take her from him. As such, he made a bet of a thousand guineas that none of the men in his circle could seduce her. Unfortunately for Malden, Tarleton accepted the bet and swooped in to not only seduce Robinson, but establish a relationship that would last the next 15 years. This relationship, though rumored to have started on a bet, saw Tarleton's rise in military rank and his concomitant political successes, Mary's own various illnesses, financial vicissitudes and the efforts of Tarleton's own family to end the relationship. They had no children, although Robinson had a miscarriage. However, in the end, Tarleton married Susan Bertie, an heiress and an illegitimate daughter of the young 4th Duke of Ancaster, and niece of his sisters Lady Willoughby de Eresby and Lady Cholmondeley. In 1783, Robinson suffered a mysterious illness that left her partially paralysed. Biographer Paula Byrne speculates that a streptococcal infection resulting from a miscarriage led to a severe rheumatic fever that left her disabled for the rest of her life.  

From the late 1780s, Robinson became distinguished for her poetry and was called "the English Sappho".  In addition to poems, she wrote eight novels, three plays, feminist treatises, and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death.  Like her contemporary Mary Wollstonecraft, she championed the rights of women and was an ardent supporter of the French Revolution.  She died in poverty at Englefield Cottage, Englefield Green, Surrey, 26 December 1800, aged 44, having survived several years of ill health, and was survived by her daughter, Maria Elizabeth (1774-1818), who was also a published novelist. Administration of her estate was granted to her husband Thomas Robinson from whom she had long been separated and who in 1803 inherited a substantial estate from his half-brother William. One of Robinson’s dying wishes was to see the rest of her works published. She tasked her daughter, Maria Robinson, with publishing most of these works. She also placed her Memoirs in the care of her daughter, insisting that she publish the work. Maria Robinson published Memoirs just a few months later.

# Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby

Lord Rokeby died in December 1800, peacefully in his bed.  His title and estates passed to his nephew Morris Robinson, 3rd Baron Rokeby.

# Edward Rutledge

After his release he returned to the General Assembly, where he served until 1796. He was known as an active legislator and an advocate for the confiscation of Loyalist property. Like John Rutledge, Edward Rutledge opposed the Jay Treaty and the Anglophilic stance he perceived in the Federalist Party. As an elector in the 1796 Presidential Election, Rutledge voted for the two Southern candidates, Republican Thomas Jefferson and Federalist Thomas Pinckney. Rutledge had not been close with the eventual victor John Adams dating back to their days in the Continental Congress, but he approved of Adams's defense policies towards France during the Quasi-War. The opposition afforded Adams's measures by Vice President Jefferson and the Congressional Republicans angered Rutledge because he now saw the Republicans as more partial to France than to American interests, a situation similar to the pro-British feelings he sensed in the Federalists during the Jay Treaty debates. Rutledge thereafter ceased communication with Jefferson. Rutledge served in the state senate for two years, then was elected governor in 1798.

Governor Rutledge, while attending an important meeting in Columbia, had to be sent home because of his gout. He died in Charleston before the end of his term. Some said at the time that he died from apoplexy resulting from hearing the news of George Washington's death.

# Valentine Sevier

Valentine Sevier died on February 23, 1800, following a lingering illness. His widow, Naomi "Amy" Douglas Sevier, lived until 1844, dying at the age of 101.

# Mary Bowes, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne

After 1792, Mary lived quietly in Purbrook Park in Hampshire. She later moved to Stourfield House, an isolated mansion on the edge of the village of Pokesdown near Christchurch, Hampshire, where she could live feeling that she was "...out of the world.." She brought to Stourfield a full establishment of servants, including Mary Morgan, the maid who had helped her escape her marital home. Morgan died in 1796 and was buried beneath a brass plaque composed by Mary. Following this death, Mary did not socialise at all, but spent most of her time looking after pet animals, including a large number of dogs, for whom hot dinners were cooked daily. Local people found her very strange, if not actually mad. However, she occasionally tried to reach out to them, ordering dinners cooked for the men working in the fields, and having beer sent out to refresh them. Details of Mary's life at Stourfield House have been preserved in the transcribed memoirs of an elderly Pokesdown resident.

Mary's three sons by the Earl seldom visited their mother, and never stayed long. However, two of Mary's daughters lived with her – Lady Jessop, the Earl's daughter; and Mary Bowes, who was born during the term of Mary's second marriage. One of Mary's few joys was to see her daughter Mary learning to ride – at this time, riding brought great independence; journey times were about a third that of going by coach.

Towards the close of the century, Mary called in some trusted friends from Pokesdown village to witness her final will, and began making presents of dresses and other items to the community. She also left an annuity for the widow Lockyer of Pokesdown Farm.

Mary died on 28 April 1800. Undertakers came from London with a hearse and three mourning carriages and transported her body to London. Mary was buried in Westminster Abbey, where her tombstone stands in the Poets' Corner. According to the locals, she was buried as per her request in a court dress, with all the accessories necessary for a Royal audience, plus a small silver trumpet. Other reports have it that she was buried in a bridal dress. Soon after her death, the contents of Stourfield House were sold.

Mary Eleanor Bowes was the great great great grandmother of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the late Queen Mother.

# French Strother

French Strother died, aged 70, in Fredericksburg on July 3, 1799, on his way home to Culpeper from the Virginia Senate session in Richmond. He is buried in the cemetery of St. George's Church in Fredericksburg.

The family continued to use his name for years. Several of his descendants became U.S. Congressman, including his son George Strother, who would later move with his family and slaves to Missouri. His grandson James French Strother continued the family's political tradition, and practiced law in Culpeper as well as represented it in the Virginia House of Delegates, becoming its speaker as well as serving as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1850, then winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Whig. His great-grandson, also James French Strother (1868-1930) would represent West Virginians in the U.S. House of Representatives (but as a Republican). Another grandson Daniel French Slaughter (1799-1881) would also represent Culpeper County in the Virginia Senate. A descendent, Jane Chapman Slaughter (1860-1951) would become the first woman to receive a PhD. from the University of Virginia, become a noted genealogist, and donate her papers to the University of Virginia Library. Several of French Strother's descendants served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil war, including C.S.A. Brig. Gen. James E. Slaughter, a VMI graduate who had served with distinction in the Mexican American War, then fought for the Confederacy and claimed never to have surrendered, but fired the last shots of the Confederacy in Texas, crossed into Mexico for years, the made his home in Mobile, Alabama and died in New Orleans, Louisiana.

# Nikephoros Theotokis

Nikephoros retired from his archbishop position on June 15, 1792, due to ill health. The Holy Synod appointed him the abbot of the small Danilov Monastery of the Holy Trinity in Pereslavl-Zalessky. Instead of going to the rural Pereslavl, the retired archbishop requested to be left in Moscow, and on September 29, 1792, he was appointed the abbot of Moscow's Danilov Monastery. Nikephoros and spent the rest of his days there, presiding over the monastery's small staff (12 monks and 8 employees, according to the official budget), and continuing his literary work.

The retired archbishop died in 1800 in Moscow and was buried in the monastery's cemetery. His gravestone was destroyed in the 1930s, along with the rest of the cemetery. As of 2006, the monastery reported having approximately determined the location of the grave (based on old records), and planning archaeological excavations in the area.

# Artemas Ward

Even during his military service, Ward served as a state court justice in 1776 and 1777.  He was President of the state's Executive Council from 1777–1779, which effectively made him the governor before the 1780 ratification of the Massachusetts Constitution.  He was continuously elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives for each year from 1779 through 1785.  He also served as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1780 and 1781.  Ward was the Speaker of the Massachusetts House in 1785.  He was elected twice to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1791 to 1795.

Ward died at his home in Shrewsbury on October 28, 1800, and is buried with Sarah in the town's Mountain View Cemetery. His great-grandson, Artemas Ward wrote The Grocer's Encyclopedia (published in 1911).

# Harry Washington

The Sierra Leone Company responded by sending a corps of recently arrived black Jamaican maroons against the rebels. In the trials that followed the defeat of the rebellion, Washington was among the rebels sentenced to banishment to Bullom Shore, another location in Sierra Leone. He became one of the two leaders of a new settlement, but died there of disease. His descendants and those of other African Americans make up a portion of the Sierra Leone Creole people.

# John White (Frontenac County)

As attorney general for the province, he wrote the bill in 1793 which barred the introduction of additional slaves, and the legislation which established trial by jury, district courts and Court of the King's Bench.  White played an important role in founding the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1797 and was its first treasurer.  Legislation passed during the first four years of his tenure includes:

The introduction and passage of the 1793 act against slavery was not without opposition.  Four of the original sixteen members of the Legislative Assembly were slave owners: John McDonell, Hazelton Spencer, Peter Van Alstine and David William Smith, and a significant number of landowners.  Nine members of the Legislative Council, some of whom were also Executive Councillors, were slave owners or members of slave-owning families.  White wrote that there was "much opposition but little argument" to his bill.

As a result of an affair with the wife of John Small, the clerk of the Executive Council of Upper Canada, White was challenged by Small to a duel in York on January 2, 1800. He was shot and died 2 days later. He lived beyond his means and was often in debt, and his estate went unsettled for 37 years.

# Ned Young

In 1799 Young began to suffer from asthma. At about the same time, he became more religious. The other islanders converted to Christianity, and Young taught Adams and several of the children to read and write. Young's health became progressively worse and eventually he died of asthma, but Adams continued his work of educating the women and children, taking control over leadership of the island, and lived to see the island rediscovered by American and British ships.

Many of Young's and the mutineers descendants continue to live on Pitcairn Island or Norfolk Island.
