# John Dyke Acland

He died aged 34 on 31 October 1778, and thus predeceased his father. He left an infant son born in 1778, aged only a few months old, who died 7 years later, having inherited the baronetcy from his grandfather, and a daughter Elizabeth "Kitty". His widow Harriet lived on at Pixton until 1796 when it was given to her daughter as part of her marriage settlement, and then at Tetton, until her death in 1815.

# Charles Darwin (medical student)

This very talented medical student died on 15 May 1778, apparently from a cut sustained while performing an autopsy.
"About the end of April, Mr. Darwin had employed the greatest part of a day in accurately dissecting the brain of a child which had died of hydrocephalus, and which he had attended during its life. That very evening he was seized with severe head-ach. This, however, did not prevent him from being present in the Medical Society, where he mentioned to Dr. Duncan the dissection he had made, and promised the next day to furnish him with an account of all the circumstances in writing. But the next day, to his headach there supervened other febrile symptoms. And, in a short time, from the hemorrhagies, petechial eruption, and foetid loose stools which occurred,his disease manifested a very putrescent tendency.


The clinical picture described here, particularly the petechial haemorrhages, strongly supports a diagnosis of meningococcal disease.

Charles Darwin was buried in the family vault of his professor and mentor, Andrew Duncan MD, in the graveyard of the chapel of ease built on the south side of Edinburgh for the Parish Church of St Cuthbert which is to the north west of the old town. The graveyard was later renamed the Buccleuch Parish Church Burying Ground, and is sited at 33 Chapel Street, not far from the Old College of the University of Edinburgh.
