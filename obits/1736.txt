# Antonio Claudio Álvarez de Quiñones

Álvarez de Quiñones died in Bogotá on 21 October 1736. He left a large estate, including the episcopal palace and a number of black slaves, and his successor as archbishop, Juan de Galavís, spent much of his short term as archbishop consolidating his will, which had 226 pages with 452 individual sections. In his will, he left "generous donations" to a variety of institutions.

# Francis Clifton

Clifton also held the appointment of physician to Frederick, Prince of Wales, which he resigned, and abruptly quitted London for Jamaica in 1734. Writing to Sir Hans Sloane from Kingston in that island on 3 June 1736, he says : "My misfortunes came so fast upon me, and my brother's provocations were so frequently repeated, that I was hurried in a manner to death about 'em". He died a few weeks afterwards, leaving no issue by his wife, Sarah Banckes, daughter of a merchant in Leadenhall Street. In the letters of administration P.C.C. granted on 6 Nov. 1736 to his widow, Clifton is described as "late of the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, Middlesex, but at Kingston in Jamaica, deceased". His widow survived until 1747, and was buried in the parish church of St. Andrew Undershaft.

At the time of his death Clifton was engaged in drawing up an account of the diseases of Jamaica, but left it unfinished. He also published Hippocrates upon Air, Water, and Situation ... To this is added Thucydides' Account of the Plague of Athens. Translated and ... illustrated with notes (London 1734).

# William Cosby

Cosby died of tuberculosis on 10 March 1736, between 1 and 2 pm, in the Governor's House at Ft. George, today's Battery Park, New York City.

First, he was buried in a vault at Ft. George's chapel (1736). But in 1788, his remains were moved to an unmarked grave at St Paul Church's Cemetery, New York, together with the remains of the Earl of Bellomont, who served as New York governor between 1698 and 1701.

George Clarke, the sitting lieutenant governor, assumed Cosby's office. He was a moderate loyalist of the Court Party, a former representative in the Provincial Council. He frustrated Van Dam's aspirations again, starting another political scandal. Nonetheless, Clarke received royal confirmation officially.

# Henry Cunningham

Cunningham did not arrive in Jamaica until 18 December 1735, and died less than two months later on 12 February 1736, aged 59. His wife predeceased him and they had no children. His estates were subsequently sold to pay his debts.

Cunningham appears in an introduction to Rob Roy by Sir Walter Scott as putting Rob Roy to flight when the outlaw picked a fight with him. The author described Cunningham as uniting ‘a natural high spirit and daring character with an affectation of delicacy of address and manners amounting to foppery.'.

# Edward des Bouverie

des Bouverie died on 21 November 1736 at Aix-en-Provence aged 47 or 48. His wife Lady Mary had died on 3 January 1721, and was buried at Britford. They had no issue and on Sir Edward's death  he was succeeded by his younger brother Jacob. He was buried at Britford.

# Prince Eugene of Savoy

During the last 20 years of his life Eugene was particularly close to Countess Eleonora Batthyány, daughter of Count Theodor von Strattman.
Much about their acquaintance remains speculative (Eugene never mentions her in any of his surviving letters), and there is certainly no suggestion of a sexual relationship, but although they lived apart most foreign diplomats regarded Eleonora as his "official lover". Eugene and Eleonora were constant companions, meeting for dinner, receptions and card games almost every day till his death. But their surviving correspondence does not indicate any real intimacy in the relationship. Eugene's other friends such as the papal nuncio, Passionei, made up for the family he still lacked.

For his only surviving nephew, Emmanuel, the son of his brother Louis Thomas, Eugene arranged a marriage with one of the daughters of Prince Liechtenstein, but Emmanuel died of smallpox in 1729. With the death of Emmanuel's son in 1734, no close male relatives remained to succeed the Prince. His closest relative, therefore, was Louis Thomas's unmarried daughter, Princess Maria Anna Victoria of Savoy, whom Eugene had never met and, as he had heard nothing but bad of her, made no effort to do so.

Eugene returned to Vienna from the War of the Polish Succession in October 1735, weak and feeble; when Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen married in February 1736 Eugene was too ill to attend. After playing cards at Countess Batthyány's on the evening of 20 April he returned to his bed at the Stadtpalais. When his servants arrived to wake him the next morning, 21 April 1736, they found Prince Eugene dead after choking from phlegm in his throat, presumably after suffering from pneumonia. Eugene's heart was buried with those of others of his family in Turin. His remains were carried in a long procession to St. Stephen's Cathedral, where the body was interred in the Kreuzkapelle.

Countess Batthyány expressed in a letter dated 23 December 1720, that at the Kreuzkapelle a solemn requiem would be held annually. She dedicated for this purpose two thousand guilders.

# Francis Folger Franklin

Franklin and his brother, James, criticized smallpox inoculation, which was performed by drawing a string, previously in contact with the pustules of a smallpox victim, through a small incision on the person being inoculated. At the time, inoculation offered a mortality chance of 2%, while smallpox contracted naturally was fatal to 15% of the infected. Later, while James still opposed inoculation, Franklin came to support it, believing it was a "safe and beneficial practice." In 1736, however, Francis contracted smallpox and died on November 21 of that year, without having been inoculated. Both Franklin and Deborah were devastated, and their devastation was compounded because they were unsure they could have another child. Franklin had written his paper, "On the Death of Infants", while Francis was still alive, and was inspired by his youngest son when writing about the beauty of babies. Francis was buried on the same day he died, his tombstone reading "The delight of all who knew him."

Rumors quickly surfaced that Francis had died after being inoculated, and so, Franklin wrote in the Pennsylvania Gazette, on December 30, that "[he] intended to get [Francis] inoculated as soon as he should have recovered sufficient strength from a flux with which he had been long afflicted," and that the boy "received the distemper in the common way of infection." However, the choice of having his son inoculated was a difficult one for Franklin, as Francis could die either way. Inoculation would become a real choice only if there was a high chance of smallpox being contracted naturally. In this case, the choice of having Francis inoculated was justified, even with its 2% mortality rate.


After Francis' death, Franklin became involved in promoting inoculation in Philadelphia: he published many studies on its value, working with several physicians, including the famed William Heberden at the Pennsylvania Hospital, which he helped found. In 1774, he founded the "Society for Inoculating the Poor Gratis", in order to help the poor people of Philadelphia afford inoculation. In his autobiography, Franklin writes: 
Seven years after Francis' death, Deborah gave birth to Sarah, who was Franklin's only surviving, legitimate child.  In 1772, Franklin's sister Jane Franklin Mecom, wrote him with news of his grandsons. Franklin replied that it "brings often afresh to my mind the idea of my son Franky, though now dead thirty-six years, whom I have seldom since seemed equaled in everything, and whom to this day I cannot think of without a sigh."

# Stephen Gray (scientist)

Despite the importance of his discoveries (it can be argued that he was the inventor of electrical communications), he received little credit, supposedly because of the factional dispute in the Royal Society, and the dominance of Newtonianism. Desaguliers achieved far more fame than Gray, and many of Gray's discoveries became attached to the name Desaguliers by virtue of his flamboyant demonstrations.  By the time Gray's priority was publicly recognised, experiments in electricity had moved on and people were interested more in the spectacular feats by Franklin and others in capturing lightning in their Leyden Jars. Gray's discoveries tended to look trivial, and for this reason, some historians tend to overlook his work.

There is no monument to Gray and little recognition of what he achieved in his scientific discoveries.  He is believed to be buried in a common grave in an old London cemetery, in an area reserved for pauper pensioners from the Charterhouse. In 2017 the School of Physical Sciences at the University of Kent, in Canterbury, initiated the Stephen Gray Lectures in his memory.

# Nicholas Hawksmoor

Hawksmoor died on 25 March 1736 in his house at Millbank from "Gout of the stomach". He had suffered poor health for the last twenty years of his life and was often confined to bed hardly able to sign his name. His will instructed that he be buried at the church at Shenley, Hertfordshire. This has been deconsecrated and his tomb stone there is now in a private garden. It has this inscription:

Hawksmoor's only child was a daughter, Elizabeth, whose second husband, Nathanial Blackerby, wrote the obituary of his father-in-law.


His obituary appeared in Read's Weekly Journal, no. 603. 27 March 1736.
Upon his death he left a widow, to whom he bequeathed all his property in Westminster, Highgate, Shenley, and East Drayton, who later married William Theaker; the grandchild of this second marriage ultimately inherited Hawksmoor's properties near Drayton after the death of the architect's widow.

# Johann Reinhard III, Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg

Johann Reinhard III. died on 28 March 1736 in Schloss Philippsruhe in Hanau. On his deathbed, he was surrounded by the diplomatic and notarized representatives of his heirs. He was buried in the family crypt in the St. Johann's Church in Hanau. The crypt was destroyed when Hanau was bombed during the Second World War.

The question whether Babenhausen belonged to Hanau-Lichtenberg or Hanau-Münzenberg was disputed for decades after his death. It was settled at the end of the 18th century by dividing the district.

# Sir Patrick Johnston

Johnston died on 7 September 1736. He and his wife had at least 11 children many of whom died in infancy. His eldest son, Patrick, followed him in trade but did not aspire to a political career. Other surviving sons included Cpt. George Johnston of Kimmerghame and Monkstown (1686-1770). His daughter Harriet married Sir John Warrender son of Sir George Warrender, 1st Baronet. Sir George Warrender was Lord Provost from 1713 to 1715. He was grandfather to General James Johnston governor of Minorca (George's son).
His many uncles included James Johnston.
His nephews included David Hume.

# Valentine Browne, 3rd Viscount Kenmare

He died on 30 June 1736, aged 41.

# John Porteous (soldier)

However, public resentment at a possible reprieve was such that a plot to murder Captain Porteous was hatched, and when the authorities heard of this, it was decided to increase the guard at the Tolbooth prison. However, on the evening before this was due to happen, a large crowd of over four thousand gathered at Portsburgh, west of the city.

Making their way across the Grassmarket to the Cowgate and up the High Street, the mob converged on the Tolbooth, where they were eventually able to overpower the guards. Porteous was dragged from his cell and up the Lawnmarket towards the West Bow and the Grassmarket, where he was lynched from a dyer's pole, using a rope taken from a local draper's shop. After a short while, he was dragged down and stripped of his nightgown and shirt, which was then wrapped around his head before he was hauled up again. However, the mob had not tied his hands and, as he struggled free, they broke his arm and shoulder, while another attempted to set light to his naked foot. He was taken down a further time and cruelly beaten before being hung up again. He died a short while later, just before midnight on 7 September 1736.

The spot where Porteous died is today marked by a memorial plate in the Grassmarket. The site of the Tolbooth is marked by paving stones arranged in the form of a heart, 'The Heart of Midlothian'. Tour guides will say that, even today, passers-by will spit on the spot, a tradition originally intended to demonstrate their contempt for the hated Tolbooth.

Porteous was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, on 9 September, near the westmost wall of the original graveyard. For more than two hundred years, the grave was marked by a small square stone with the single letter P and the date 1736. In 1973, this was replaced with a headstone of Craigleith stone, bearing the inscription "John Porteous, a captain of the City Guard of Edinburgh, murdered September 7, 1736. All Passion Spent, 1973".

# Walter Pringle, Lord Newhall

On his death, on 14 December 1736, a special tribute was paid to Pringle's remains, his funeral being attended by his judicial colleagues in their robes of office. The Faculty of Advocates included in their minutes a eulogy on Pringle, written by Sir Robert Dundas of Arniston, then dean of faculty. His niece Katherine was married to William Hamilton of Bangour the poet, who wrote a verse epitaph.

# Philip Rashleigh (1689–1736)

Rashleigh died unmarried on 12 August 1736, and his estates were inherited by his younger brother Jonathan.

# Anthony Sadowski

Sadowski died on April 22, 1736 in Amityville, Pennsylvania, and is buried in the cemetery of Old St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church in Douglassville.

His grave marker bears the following inscription:

 However, French maps as early as 1718 identified Sandusky Bay as Lac Sandouské.

# Thomas Sclater

Sclater/Bacon died childless worth £200,000 on 22 August 1736 at the age of about 71. His wife had died in 1726, which was after Sclater had made a will in 1724 leaving his estate for life to Sarah, the wife of his coachman whom he described as a ‘kinswoman’ with remainder to her two sons. Elizabeth’s will of 1724 left her personal fortune to her step-brothers after Thomas Sclater-Bacon’s death.

# Tukkoji

Tukkoji died in 1736. He left behind one legitimate son Ekoji who succeeded to the throne on the death of his father. But he ruled for not more than a year. However he had a number of offspring from his concubines. A three-year-long period of anarchy followed his death. It came to an end only with the accession of Pratapsingh in 1739.

# António Manoel de Vilhena

Vilhena died on 10 (or 12) December 1736 at the age of 73, and was succeeded as Grand Master by Ramon Despuig. He was buried at the Chapel of the Langue of Castile, Leon and Portugal within the Conventual Church of St. John (now known as St. John's Co-Cathedral). His funerary monument was designed by the Florentine sculptor Massimiliano Soldani Benzi.

Fort Manoel is supposedly haunted by a ghost known as the Black Knight, who resembles de Vilhena.
