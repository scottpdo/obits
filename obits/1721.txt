# Abdul Jalil Shah IV of Johor

Following the victory of Raja Kecil forces, the deposed Abdul Jalil Shah was re-appointed as Bendahara of the kingdom and lived at Kota Tinggi. By the end of 1718, he retired to Terengganu and further removed to Pahang in 1719. On July 11, 1721, he established Kuala Pahang as his new capital and made attempts to recover his kingdom with the support of nobles from Johor, Pahang and Kelantan.

There were now three power centres in the Malay world. Raja Kecil in Riau, Abdul Jalil Shah IV on the east coast of the Peninsula and the Bugis in Selangor and Linggi. The Bugis eventually won the day, in part because Raja Kecil had sabotaged his own popularity by having Abdul Jalil Riayat Shah IV killed in Kuala Pahang.

Abdul Jalil Riayat Shah IV was killed while conducting his prayers on board his ship, by an emissary sent by Raja Kecil off Kuala Pahang, on November 21, 1721. The Sultan was buried at Royal Cemetery, Kuala Pahang.

Raja Kecil finally admitted defeat in 1722, and the Bugis installed Raja Sulaiman, the son of Abdul Jalil Shah IV as the next Sultan of Johor.

Zul Karan determined to have the quarrel out, gathered men together, and attacked his brother. The elders of the place sent word to Churaman Singh spoke to Muhkam. The son replied to his father in abusive language, and showed himself ready to fight his father as well as his brother.Thakur Churaman Singh lost his temper, and from chagrin swallowed up a dose of deadly poison which he always carried with him and going to an orchard in that village lay down and gave up the ghost.
