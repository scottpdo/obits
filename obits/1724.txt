# Arthur Champneys

He died in 1724 in London and was buried on 2 April 1724 at the Church of St Dionis Backchurch (demolished 1878) in the City of London. The large mural monument to his father-in-law in the chancel of that church made reference to him as follows:

# Jonathan Singletary Dunham

Dunham died in Woodbridge, New Jersey in 1724. The house the Dunhams built in 1671, the Jonathan Singletary Dunham House, still stands and currently serves as the Rectory of the Trinity Episcopal Church.

In the words of Woodridge historian Rev. Joseph W. Dally, "Dunham was a man of great energy. When he determined upon an enterprise he pushed it forward to success with indomitable perseverance. So many of his relatives settled in the north of the Kirk Green that the neighborhood was known as Dunhamtown for many years."

In addition to one of the original millstones used by Dunham, two memorial plaques have been placed in front of the Trinity Church Rectory. The first plaque reads, "This millstone from the mill of Jonathan Dunham builder of Trinity Church Rectory 1670 was placed here by Trinity Young Peoples Fellowship on the 250th Anniversary of Trinity Church May 16, 1948."[citation needed] The second memorial plaque reads, "In Memory of Jonathan Dunham who in 1670 established the First Grist Mill in New Jersey at Woodbridge, New Jersey and built the Brick House now Trinity Church Rector dedicated October 5, 1969 by the 300th Anniversary Comm. of Woodbridge Township NJ."[citation needed]

# John Evans (bishop)

Evans died at Dublin on 22 March 1724, and was buried in the churchyard of St. George's Chapel, under a monument upon which his widow commemorated his many virtues and his twenty years' chaplaincy in India. He left £1,000 for an episcopal house at Ardbraccan, £140 for the rectory of Llanaelhaiarn, the personal estate acquired previously to his translation to be applied by the governors of Queen Anne's Bounty for the benefit of poor clergy in England, and that afterwards acquired for the benefit of churches in Meath.

# Sir Samuel Garrard, 4th Baronet

Garrard died on 10 March 1724, and was buried in Wheathamstead Church, where a monument remains to his memory. His will, dated 20 December 1723, was proved in the P. C. C. on 1 April 1725. His property included estates in Exhall and Bedworth, Warwickshire; in Wheathamstead, Hertfordshire; and in the city of London; besides stock and annuities in the South Sea Company.

Garrard was twice married: first, on 16 October 1675, to Elizabeth Poyner of Codicote Bury, Hertfordshire; and secondly, on 22 January 1688-9, to Jane, daughter of Thomas Bennett of Salthrop, Wiltshire. By the latter marriage he had five daughters and three surviving sons, Samuel (died 1761), who succeeded to the baronetcy; Thomas (died 1758), who became Common Serjeant of London; and Bennet (died 1767), who was Member of Parliament for Amersham and sixth and last baronet.

# Glückel of Hameln

Glückel was born into a wealthy family in the city of Hamburg in 1646 or 1647, one of six children born to Judah Joseph Leib and his second wife Beila. She had one brother, Wolf, and five sisters: Rebekah, Elkel, Hendele, and Mate. Her father was a successful diamond trader and parnas, a leader in the Jewish community; her mother was also involved in business. In 1649, when Glückel was less than three years old, her family and the rest of Hamburg's Ashkenazic Jewish community was expelled to Altona. Her father had been so respected in Hamburg that he was the first German Jew permitted to return. Glückel's father ensured that all of his children were both pious and well-educated, including his daughters. Although she was unable to study the Torah, Glückel received a formal education in a Cheder, the traditional Jewish school, where she learned Hebrew and the basics of Judaism.

When she was twelve years old, Glückel was betrothed to Hayyim of Hameln, whom she married in 1660 at the age of fourteen. After the marriage, the couple lived in the groom's parents’ home in Hameln. A year after their marriage, the couple moved in with Glückel's parents in Hamburg, where Hayyim began dealing in gold and became an affluent businessman. A year after that, they became parents for the first time. Glückel assisted her husband in trading seed pearls, eventually taking over the family business when he died in 1689. She was one of few women who traveled by themselves to conduct trade at European markets and fairs. In addition to her business dealings, Glückel also maintained an extremely active social life which often required extensive travel. Her memoirs tell of travels to cities as varied as Amsterdam, Bamberg, Danzig, Hanover, Hildesheim, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Berlin, Vienna, Metz, and Paris.

Glückel and Hayyim had a total of fourteen children, thirteen of whom survived to adulthood: Zipporah (c. 1661), Nathan (c. 1663), Mata (c. 1666), Mordechai (c. 1670),  Hannah (c. 1672), Loeb (c. 1673), Esther (c. 1677), Joseph (c. 1677), Hendelchen (c. 1678), Samuel (c. 1680), Freudchen (c. 1684), Moses (c. 1685), and Miriam (c. 1686). Glückel took great pride in the fact that many of her children were married into some of the most prominent Jewish families of Europe.

In 1700, eleven years after Hayyim's death, Glückel remarried. Although she had rejected a number of proposals, she finally acquiesced as she believed that remarrying would ultimately benefit her children by protecting their future. Her second husband was Cerf Levy, a successful banker and parnas from Metz. Two years after their marriage, Levy failed financially, losing not only his own fortune but hers as well. Still deep in the throes of bankruptcy, Levy died in 1712, leaving Glückel a widow for the second time. Ever fearful of becoming a burden to her children, Glückel lived alone until falling too ill to care for herself in 1715. At the age of seventy, after much pleading from her children, she moved in with her daughter Esther and her son-in-law Moses.

Glückel died from natural causes on September 19, 1724, in Metz.

# Pope Innocent XIII

Innocent XIII fell ill in 1724. He was tormented by a hernia of which he spoke to nobody but his valet. At one point, it had burst and caused inflammation and fever. Innocent XIII asked for the last rites, made his profession of faith, and died on 7 March 1724, at the age of 68. His pontificate was unremarkable, given that he was hampered by physical suffering. He was interred in the grottoes at Saint Peter's Basilica.

In 2005 upon the occasion of the 350 years since the birth of the late pontiff, the citizens in the late pope's village of birth asked the Holy See to introduce the cause of beatification for Innocent XIII.

# William Lowndes (1652–1724)

Lowndes' death was announced in the House of Commons by Walpole, saying The House had lost a very useful Member, and the public as able and honest a servant as ever the Crown had.

Lowndes married four times:

Lowndes had children with each of his wives, 25 children in all. His offspring were also fruitful: one son had 16 children, including four sets of twins in four years; a grandson had 10 children.

He was succeeded by his son Richard, who inherited Winslow Hall and became both High Sheriff and MP for Buckinghamshire.

William Lowndes, a son by his third wife, followed him as an Auditor of His Majesty's Court of Exchequer in the 1760s.[citation needed]

# John Phillips (pirate)

The last of these captures near Nova Scotia was a sloop commanded by Andrew Harradine.  This latter conspired with some other prisoners who had previously been forced to join the crew, planning to mutiny and kill Captain Phillips.  Harradine and his allies attacked the Revenge's leaders on April 18, killing Phillips as well as his sailing master, boatswain, and gunner.  Archer was temporarily spared, but died on the gallows at Boston with three of the other pirates on June 2, 1724. The pirates gave widely reprinted speeches before their executions. Archer blamed drinking but also blamed brutal merchant captains who drove oppressed sailors to seek piracy as a tempting way to escape.

Phillips had survived less than eight months as a pirate captain but in this short period he had captured 34 ships.

# Daniel Quare

Quare died on 21 March 1724, aged 75, at his country house at Croydon, and was buried in the Quaker burial ground, Chequer Alley, Bunhill Fields, on 27 March. The Daily Post of Thursday, 26 March, reported: "Last week dy'd Mr. Daniel Quare, watchmaker in Exchange Alley, who was famous both here and at foreign courts for the great improvements he made in that art, and we hear he is succeeded in his shop and trade by his partner, Mr. Horseman", i.e. Stephen Horseman, apprenticed to Quare in 1702, and admitted to the Clockmakers' Company in 1709.

His will, made on 3 May 1723, was proved on 26 March 1724 by Jeremiah, his son and executor. Among other bequests, Quare left to his wife £2,800, all his household goods, both in London and in the country, and "the two gold watches she usually wears, one of them being a repeater and the other a plain watch". The widow lived with her son, Jeremiah, until her death on 4 November 1728 (aged 77) in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch, Lime Street. Of Quare's children who survived infancy there were, besides the son Jeremiah, a "merchant", three daughters: Anna, married to John Falconer; Sarah, wife of Jacob Wyan; and Elizabeth, who married, on 10 November 1715, Silvanus Bevan, "citizen and apothecary". At Elizabeth's wedding, Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, signed the register (along with seventy-two other witnesses).

# Sampson Lloyd (iron manufacturer)

He died aged 60 on 3 January 1724. The executors to his will were his widow, his son Sampson II, his son-in- 
law John Gulson and his brother-in-law John Pemberton.

# Sophia of Saxe-Weissenfels, Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst

Sophia died at the age of 69 years in her rooms at Zerbst Castle and was buried on 7 June 1724 in the princely tomb in the St. Bartholomew's Church in Zerbst.  In 1899 Duke Duke Frederick I of Anhalt, ordered the implementation of a princely family vault in the Castle Church in Zerbst Castle.  After the destruction of the castle in 1945, the remains of the damaged coffins were transferred back to St. Bartholomew.

# Sir William Strickland, 3rd Baronet

Strickland died in May 1724 from a fall at a fox hunt. His son William, who succeeded him in the baronetcy, was the only one of his children who survived to adulthood.

# John Richmond Webb

Webb died on 5 September 1724. He left his estates to his second son Borlase Richmond Webb to the exclusion of his eldest son Edmund. His eldest son by his second wife, also called John Richmond Webb, was a lawyer, and briefly a judge and Member of Parliament. Webb's brother Thomas Richmond Webb was an ancestor of the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, and Webb is sympathetically depicted in Thackeray's historical novel The History of Henry Esmond
