# Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 9th Baronet

He died on 17 May 1794, having fallen ill during a journey to London. He was buried in the family vault in Broadclyst Church, the parish church of Killerton House. His Latin epitaph was written in the burial register of Selworthy Church, the parish church of Holnicote, as follows:




Hic finis fatorum Priami hic exitus illum
Sorte tulit! - Vale. Vale. Vale.
Nec Meridies nec Aurora unquam vident ejus ora.
Reliquit nobis cornu, canes, tandem quiescant ejus manes.
("This was the fated end of Priam's empire and of his own life! Farewell. Farewell. Farewell. Neither Noon nor Dawn shall ever see his face again. He left us his horn and his hounds; may his spirit finally rest in peace".)




He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet (1787–1871), whose interests lay not in hunting but rather in politics and philanthropy, which set the trend for several generations of his descendants.

# Henriette Anne Louise d'Aguesseau

At the death of her father-in-law, Louis de Noailles, 4th Duke of Noailles, she returned to France. In May 1794, during the Reign of Terror, she was arrested at Hôtel de Noailles and imprisoned in Luxembourg Prison (see Prison du Luxembourg) in Paris.

Along with her mother-in-law, Catherine de Cossé-Brissac duchesse de Noailles, and daughter, Anne Jeanne Baptiste Louise vicomtesse d'Ayen, she was guillotined, on 22 July 1794. She was buried in a mass grave at Picpus Cemetery.

The Château de la Grange-Bléneau passed from her maternal grandfather, through her, to her daughter, Adrienne de La Fayette.

# Jean-François Autié

Jean-François Autié probably died in Paris under the guillotine on 7 thermidor an II (25 July 1794), although this has been disputed. Will Bashor suggests that with  assistance he may have arranged for another nameless prisoner to take his place at the guillotine and fled France for America.

# Gertrude Russell, Duchess of Bedford

The duchess died at the age of 79 and was buried on 7 July 1794 at Chenies, Buckinghamshire.

Gower Street, London, is named after the duchess.

# Bob Benge

Benge raided as far as the westernmost counties of Virginia, attacking Gate City, Virginia in 1791, and Moccasin Gap and Kane's Gap on Powell Mountain in 1793.

He was killed April 6, 1794 in an ambush in what is in what is now Wise County, Virginia during an extended raid deep into enemy-held territory, while escorting prisoners captured from a settlement earlier in the day back to the Lower Towns. The militia took his scalp and sent it to the Governor of Virginia, Henry Lee III, who sent it on to President George Washington. Credit for killing Benge went to militia leader Vincent Hobbs Jr, son of one of the original white settlers of current Lee County, Virginia.

# Susanna Blamire

Blamire suffered from a recurrent and severe form of rheumatic heart disease, which killed her at the age of 47.

She died on 5 April 1794 in Carlisle and is buried by her own request at Raughton Head chapel.

# Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra

After suffering from chronic headaches for several years, in April 1793 Bodega y Quadra requested a leave from his duties to restore his health. It was granted and he left San Blas for Guadalajara and Mexico City. He suffered a strong fluxo de sangre (blood loss or haemorrhage) in Guadalajara. He had a seizure in Mexico City and died there on March 26, 1794, at the age of 50. The internist Dr. John Naish has conjectured that Bodega y Quadra's death was the result of either a brain tumor or the severest form of hypertension. Given the lack of details and the imprecision contemporary diagnosis and description, Viceroy Revillagigedo's official statement that Bodega died "of natural causes" is indisputable.

When George Vancouver, at Nootka Sound again in September 1794, learned of Bodega's death, he wrote in his journal (grammar and misspellings from the original):




"The death of our highly valuable and much esteemed friend Senr Quadra, who in the month of March had died at St. Blas, universally lamaneted. Having endeavoured, on a former occasion, to point out the degree of admiration and respect with which the conduct of Sen'r Quadra toward our little community had impressed us during his life, I cannot refrain, now that he is no more, from rendering that justice to his memory to which it is so amply intitled, by stating, that the unexpected melancholey event of his decease operated on the minds of us all, in a way more easily to be imagined than described: and whilst it excited our most grateful acknowledgements, it produced the deepest regret for the loss of a character so amiable, and so truly ornamental to civil society."

# Harry Powlett, 6th Duke of Bolton

  Hackwood Park, Hampshire


He died on 25 December 1794 at Hackwood Park, Winslade, in Hampshire, whereupon due to his lack of male progeny his dukedom became extinct. His distant cousin and heir male George Paulet succeeded to the Marquessate of Winchester and other titles, while his estates of Bolton Hall, Bolton Castle, Hackwood Park and several others devolved upon his brother's natural daughter Jean Browne-Powlett, wife of Thomas Orde (later Thomas Orde-Powlett, 1st Baron Bolton), who adopted the additional surname of Powlett.

# Claude-François Bertrand de Boucheporn

Under the Terror, as two of his sons had emigrated to serve in the Armée des Princes, Boucheporn was arrested (June 1793) and "tried on a charge of sending money abroad." He was sentenced to death and beheaded on the Place de la Liberté  in Toulouse on 2d Ventôse, Year II (February 20, 1794), at the age of 53.

Bertrand de Boucheporn was the "9th of 31 victims of the Tribunal Révolutionnaire in Toulouse," and one of nine French intendants to die under the guillotine.

# John Charles Brooke

On 3 February 1794 he had attended the Haymarket Theatre in Pall Mall, London with Benjamin Pingo, York Herald. Both men were crushed to death in a crowd of well-wishers eager to see the King, at the side door of the theatre. According to Walter Thornbury, "Mr Brooke had died standing, as he was found as if asleep, and with colour still in his cheeks."

King George III had attended the theatre that day and was only told of the deaths of both Officers of Arms after he had departed.

John Charles Brooke is buried in St Benet Paul's Wharf, London, a church closely associated with the College of Arms.

# James Bruce

In retirement, Bruce devoted himself to the management of his estate and the oversight of his collieries. In May 1776, he married Mary Dundas, the daughter of a neighbour, with whom he had three children. After his wife's early death in 1785, and at the urging of his friend Daines Barrington, he embarked on writing up his travels, which were published in five quarto volumes (totalling 3000 pages) as Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, In the Years 1768, 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772 and 1773. The book was very successful, selling very well and being favourably reviewed in the monthly journals, but was assailed by other travellers as being unworthy of credence. The substantial accuracy of his Ethiopian travels has since been demonstrated, and it is considered that he made a real addition to the geographical knowledge of his day.

In his final years, Bruce became very corpulent. He died on 27 April 17 of injuries sustained when on the previous day he fell down stairs at Kinniard House. He was buried behind his wife in the Larbert old churchyard.

# Blackleach Burritt

In 1792 he began to preach to the Congregational Society in the village of Winhall, Vermont where he was installed pastor on January 1, 1793. Burritt is reported to have had wonderful physical strength and agility. As a preacher he was noted for fluency and a love of argument. He was regarded as somewhat visionary and unpractical, and perhaps eccentric.

He died in Winhall of a prevailing fever on August 27, 1794, aged about 50 years.

# Georg Wilhelm von dem Bussche

The French recaptured Le Quesnoy, Valenciennes and Condé-sur-l'Escaut in August. By mid-September the Coalition-held fortresses in rear were reduced and the French resumed their advance to the north. On 2 December 1794, the Duke of York returned to Great Britain, leaving Lieutenant General Count Wallmoden to take command of the 45,000-man Coalition army in the Dutch Republic. At that time there were 32 British battalions and 30 squadrons, 14 Hanoverian battalions and 16 squadrons, 14 Hessian battalions and 14 squadrons and eight French Royalist battalions and 20 squadrons. On 10 December, under the direction of Daendels, the French launched an amphibious operation across the Maas against the Bommelerwaard. The attack on Fort Sint-Andries failed completely because the garrison was warned by a French deserter. To the east, a diversionary attack led by Vandamme crossed the Waal under the cover of a fog and seized a Hanoverian battery near Gendt. Bussche appeared with the 1st and 3rd Hanoverian Grenadier Battalions and counterattacked. After a struggle in which Bussche was killed, the French spiked some of the guns and withdrew to their boats. According to one account, a cannonball tore off Bussche's hand and he died soon afterward. He was buried in the cathedral of Arnhem on 14 December 1794.
