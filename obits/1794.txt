# Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 9th Baronet

He died on 17 May 1794, having fallen ill during a journey to London. He was buried in the family vault in Broadclyst Church, the parish church of Killerton House. His Latin epitaph was written in the burial register of Selworthy Church, the parish church of Holnicote, as follows:

He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet (1787–1871), whose interests lay not in hunting but rather in politics and philanthropy, which set the trend for several generations of his descendants.

# Henriette Anne Louise d'Aguesseau

At the death of her father-in-law, Louis de Noailles, 4th Duke of Noailles, she returned to France. In May 1794, during the Reign of Terror, she was arrested at Hôtel de Noailles and imprisoned in Luxembourg Prison (see Prison du Luxembourg) in Paris.

Along with her mother-in-law, Catherine de Cossé-Brissac duchesse de Noailles, and daughter, Anne Jeanne Baptiste Louise vicomtesse d'Ayen, she was guillotined, on 22 July 1794. She was buried in a mass grave at Picpus Cemetery.

The Château de la Grange-Bléneau passed from her maternal grandfather, through her, to her daughter, Adrienne de La Fayette.

# Jean-François Autié

Jean-François Autié probably died in Paris under the guillotine on 7 thermidor an II (25 July 1794), although this has been disputed. Will Bashor suggests that with  assistance he may have arranged for another nameless prisoner to take his place at the guillotine and fled France for America.

# Gertrude Russell, Duchess of Bedford

The duchess died at the age of 79 and was buried on 7 July 1794 at Chenies, Buckinghamshire.

Gower Street, London, is named after the duchess.

# Bob Benge

Benge raided as far as the westernmost counties of Virginia, attacking Gate City, Virginia in 1791, and Moccasin Gap and Kane's Gap on Powell Mountain in 1793.

He was killed April 6, 1794 in an ambush in what is in what is now Wise County, Virginia during an extended raid deep into enemy-held territory, while escorting prisoners captured from a settlement earlier in the day back to the Lower Towns. The militia took his scalp and sent it to the Governor of Virginia, Henry Lee III, who sent it on to President George Washington. Credit for killing Benge went to militia leader Vincent Hobbs Jr, son of one of the original white settlers of current Lee County, Virginia.

# Susanna Blamire

Blamire suffered from a recurrent and severe form of rheumatic heart disease, which killed her at the age of 47.

She died on 5 April 1794 in Carlisle and is buried by her own request at Raughton Head chapel.

# Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra

After suffering from chronic headaches for several years, in April 1793 Bodega y Quadra requested a leave from his duties to restore his health. It was granted and he left San Blas for Guadalajara and Mexico City. He suffered a strong fluxo de sangre (blood loss or haemorrhage) in Guadalajara. He had a seizure in Mexico City and died there on March 26, 1794, at the age of 50. The internist Dr. John Naish has conjectured that Bodega y Quadra's death was the result of either a brain tumor or the severest form of hypertension. Given the lack of details and the imprecision contemporary diagnosis and description, Viceroy Revillagigedo's official statement that Bodega died "of natural causes" is indisputable.

When George Vancouver, at Nootka Sound again in September 1794, learned of Bodega's death, he wrote in his journal (grammar and misspellings from the original):

# Harry Powlett, 6th Duke of Bolton

He died on 25 December 1794 at Hackwood Park, Winslade, in Hampshire, whereupon due to his lack of male progeny his dukedom became extinct. His distant cousin and heir male George Paulet succeeded to the Marquessate of Winchester and other titles, while his estates of Bolton Hall, Bolton Castle, Hackwood Park and several others devolved upon his brother's natural daughter Jean Browne-Powlett, wife of Thomas Orde (later Thomas Orde-Powlett, 1st Baron Bolton), who adopted the additional surname of Powlett.

# Claude-François Bertrand de Boucheporn

Under the Terror, as two of his sons had emigrated to serve in the Armée des Princes, Boucheporn was arrested (June 1793) and "tried on a charge of sending money abroad." He was sentenced to death and beheaded on the Place de la Liberté  in Toulouse on 2d Ventôse, Year II (February 20, 1794), at the age of 53.

Bertrand de Boucheporn was the "9th of 31 victims of the Tribunal Révolutionnaire in Toulouse," and one of nine French intendants to die under the guillotine.

# John Charles Brooke

On 3 February 1794 he had attended the Haymarket Theatre in Pall Mall, London with Benjamin Pingo, York Herald. Both men were crushed to death in a crowd of well-wishers eager to see the King, at the side door of the theatre. According to Walter Thornbury, "Mr Brooke had died standing, as he was found as if asleep, and with colour still in his cheeks."

King George III had attended the theatre that day and was only told of the deaths of both Officers of Arms after he had departed.

John Charles Brooke is buried in St Benet Paul's Wharf, London, a church closely associated with the College of Arms.

# James Bruce

In retirement, Bruce devoted himself to the management of his estate and the oversight of his collieries. In May 1776, he married Mary Dundas, the daughter of a neighbour, with whom he had three children. After his wife's early death in 1785, and at the urging of his friend Daines Barrington, he embarked on writing up his travels, which were published in five quarto volumes (totalling 3000 pages) as Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, In the Years 1768, 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772 and 1773. The book was very successful, selling very well and being favourably reviewed in the monthly journals, but was assailed by other travellers as being unworthy of credence. The substantial accuracy of his Ethiopian travels has since been demonstrated, and it is considered that he made a real addition to the geographical knowledge of his day.

In his final years, Bruce became very corpulent. He died on 27 April 17 of injuries sustained when on the previous day he fell down stairs at Kinniard House. He was buried behind his wife in the Larbert old churchyard.

# Blackleach Burritt

In 1792 he began to preach to the Congregational Society in the village of Winhall, Vermont where he was installed pastor on January 1, 1793. Burritt is reported to have had wonderful physical strength and agility. As a preacher he was noted for fluency and a love of argument. He was regarded as somewhat visionary and unpractical, and perhaps eccentric.

He died in Winhall of a prevailing fever on August 27, 1794, aged about 50 years.

# Georg Wilhelm von dem Bussche

The French recaptured Le Quesnoy, Valenciennes and Condé-sur-l'Escaut in August. By mid-September the Coalition-held fortresses in rear were reduced and the French resumed their advance to the north. On 2 December 1794, the Duke of York returned to Great Britain, leaving Lieutenant General Count Wallmoden to take command of the 45,000-man Coalition army in the Dutch Republic. At that time there were 32 British battalions and 30 squadrons, 14 Hanoverian battalions and 16 squadrons, 14 Hessian battalions and 14 squadrons and eight French Royalist battalions and 20 squadrons. On 10 December, under the direction of Daendels, the French launched an amphibious operation across the Maas against the Bommelerwaard. The attack on Fort Sint-Andries failed completely because the garrison was warned by a French deserter. To the east, a diversionary attack led by Vandamme crossed the Waal under the cover of a fog and seized a Hanoverian battery near Gendt. Bussche appeared with the 1st and 3rd Hanoverian Grenadier Battalions and counterattacked. After a struggle in which Bussche was killed, the French spiked some of the guns and withdrew to their boats. According to one account, a cannonball tore off Bussche's hand and he died soon afterward. He was buried in the cathedral of Arnhem on 14 December 1794.

# Charles-Alexandre de Hénin-Liétard d'Alsace

During the Revolution he was incarcerated in the former Luxembourg Palace, then in use as a prison. On 7 July 1794, in the final days of the  Reign of Terror, he was one of 59 suspects summarily tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed as counter-revolutionary conspirators. The dowager princess survived the Revolution, dying without heirs in 1823.

# Marquis de Condorcet

The warrant forced Condorcet into hiding. He hid for five (or eight) months in the house of Mme. Vernet, on Rue Servandoni, in Paris. It was there that he wrote Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain (Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit), which was published posthumously in 1795 and is considered one of the major texts of the Enlightenment and of historical thought. It narrates the history of civilization as one of progress in the sciences, shows the intimate connection between scientific progress and the development of human rights and justice, and outlines the features of a future rational society entirely shaped by scientific knowledge.

On 25 March 1794 Condorcet, convinced he was no longer safe, left his hideout and attempted to flee Paris. He went to seek refuge at the house of Jean-Baptiste Suard, a friend of his with whom he had resided in 1772, but he was refused on the basis that he would be betrayed by one of their residents. Two days later, he was arrested in Clamart and imprisoned in Bourg-la-Reine (or, as it was known during the Revolution, Bourg-l'Égalité, "Equality Borough" rather than "Queen's Borough") where, after another two days, he was found dead in his cell. The most widely accepted theory is that his friend, Pierre Jean George Cabanis, gave him a poison which he eventually used. However, some historians believe that he may have been murdered (perhaps because he was too loved and respected to be executed). Jean-Pierre Brancourt (in his work L'élite, la mort et la révolution) claims that Condorcet was killed with a mixture of Datura stramonium and opium.

Condorcet was symbolically interred in the Panthéon in 1989, in honour of the bicentennial of the French Revolution and Condorcet's role as a central figure in the Enlightenment.  His coffin, however, was empty as his remains, originally interred in the common cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine, were lost during the nineteenth century.

# Pierre Douville

The French and British fleets engaged in battle on May 28 until June 1, 1794. On June 1, Douville and the rest of the French navy faced off against Admiral Earl Howe"in which [Douville] dismasted the British ship of the line, Marlborough, of seventy-four guns." However, Douville gained eighteen wounds from the battle, and he and his ship were captured by the British.

Douville died on July 17, 1794, in Forton Prison, located in Gosport, England. He was buried in Portsmouth, England, "with the honors of war."

# Elias Durnford

Elias Durnford died from yellow fever on 21 June 1794 while on the island of Tobago.

# Georg Forster

Based on a decree by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German subjects who collaborated with the French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set on his head and he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.

Before the reign of terror reached its climax, Forster died after a rheumatic illness in his small attic apartment at Rue des Moulins in Paris in January 1794, at the age of thirty-nine. At the time, he was making plans to visit India.

# David Franks (loyalist)

By various accounts, Franks died in the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 in Philadelphia,where he was buried in Christ Church Burial Ground. Others claim he returned again to England and died at Isleworth in October 1794.

# Richard Gibbons (jurist)

In 1788, following the failure of the Friendly Society, Gibbons attempted to have the grand jury be made the legislative assembly for the Colony of Cape Breton. Macmarick rejected this, and removed Gibbons from his various posts in March. Gibbons' dismissal was controversial amongst his supporters, and he attempted to explain his decisions to authorities in Quebec, Halifax, and London. These efforts were costly, and he sold his farm and other property to pay for them. He was restored to his posts in 1791, but did not attempt to return to Cape Breton until 1794. During his return trip, he and his family were captured and arrested in France. He died during his imprisonment on 4 August 1794 in Nantes, France.

# John Alexander Gresse

Gresse died on 19 February 1794, in his fifty-third year, and was buried at St. Anne's, Soho. He was a great collector of works of art, which were sold by auction shortly after his death, the sale occupying six days.

# Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg

Joseph II's successor, Leopold II, blamed Kaunitz for the failure and decisively restricted his competences. Kaunitz rejected further rapprochement with Prussia against Revolutionary France, in view of the weak rule of Frederick's successor, King Frederick William II—an assessment that turned out to be right in the War of the First Coalition.  He finally resigned his office upon the accession of Emperor Francis II. Kaunitz died in 1794 at his city palace in Vienna and was buried in his family vault beneath the Chapel of St. John the Baptist in Slavkov cemetery.

# John Kendrick (American sea captain)

Kendrick arrived in Honolulu (then called Fair Haven) on December 3, 1794. There were also two other British vessels: the Jackal under Captain William Brown and the Prince Lee Boo under a Captain Gordon.

This was coincidentally when Kaeokulani, the chief of Maui, invaded Oahu, meeting little resistance from his nephew Kalanikūpule. Brown sent eight men and a mate to aid Kalanikūpule's forces. Kendrick also probably sent some of his men to help the Hawaiian chief in what was later called the Battle of Kalauao. The muskets of the sailors drove Kaeo’s warriors into some hills that overshadowed Honolulu. They finally retreated into a little ravine. Kaeo tried to escape, but Brown’s men and Kendrick’s men saw his ʻahuʻula, his feather cloak, and fired at the enemy chief from their boats in the harbor to show his position to Kalanikūpule's men. The Oahu warriors killed Kaeo along with his wives and chiefs. The battle ended with Kalanikūpule as the victor.

At 10:00 the next morning, December 12, 1794, Kendrick’s brig fired a thirteen-gun salute, to which the Jackal answered with a salute back. One of the cannons was loaded with real grapeshot, though, and the shot smashed into the Washington, killing Captain Kendrick at his table on deck along with several other men. Kendrick’s body and the bodies of his dead men were taken ashore and buried on the beach in a hidden grove of palm trees. John Howel, Kendrick’s clerk, read the ship's prayer book for the captain’s funeral.

# Lotf Ali Khan

Finally, Lotf Ali Khan was betrayed by the ruler of Bam who feared that his brother had fallen into Qajar hands in Kerman. Lotf Ali Khan was captured soon after, nearby. According to legend, Lotf Ali Khan fought 14 men single-handedly for two full hours before falling.

The last of the Zand rulers was finally delivered to Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, who had long waited to exact revenge on his arch-rival.  "The page of history would be stained by a recital of the indignities offered to the royal captive..." It is reported that Lotf Ali Khan was blinded. Lotf Ali Khan was imprisoned and tortured in Tehran for nearly three years before being choked to death.

# Philippe-François-Joseph Le Bas

Faithful to Robespierre, Augustin Robespierre and Le Bas demanded to share his fate. The five deputies were taken to the Committee of General Security, questioned and then escorted to different prisons; LeBas to the Conciergerie. The mayor of the Commune ordered the janitors to refuse any member of the Convention. LeBas, as well as the others gathered in the Hôtel de Ville on 9 Thermidor. When the anti-Robespierristes under Barras and Léonard Bourdon broke into the main room of the townhall (where Le Bas had taken refuge with Maximilien Robespierre, Augustin Robespierre, St-Just and Couthon) LeBas committed suicide by pistol in the early morning of 10 Thermidor.

# Alexander Leslie (British Army officer)

On 27 December 1794, Leslie became deathly ill while traveling from Glasgow and died at the Beechwood House.

# James Lind

He died at Gosport in Hampshire, a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1794. He is buried in St Mary's Parish Churchyard in Portchester.

# Mahadaji Shinde

After the Battle of Lakheri, Mahadji was now at the zenith of his power, when he died, at his camp at Wanavdi near Pune on 12 February 1794. He left no heir, and was succeeded by Daulat Rao Scindia.

Keeney, the English biographer of Mahadaji Shinde, has described Mahadaji as the greatest man in South Asia in the 18th century. Mahadaji Shinde's role was instrumental in establishing Maratha supremacy over North India.

Shinde Chhatri, located in Wanawadi, in Pune is a memorial dedicated to Mahadji Shinde. It is a hall that marks the spot of Mahadji Shinde's cremation on 12 February 1794. The three storied memorial in Rajput architectural style, is one of the most significant landmarks in the city.

# Sir Henry Martin, 1st Baronet

He died at his Town House, 51 Upper Harley Street, London on Friday, 1 August 1794 a few weeks before his 61st birthday.

"In the death of Sir Henry Martin, Baronet, late Comptroller of the Navy, the world has been deprived of one of its nobleft ornaments; for as fuch, muft ever be efteemed a character replete with every virtue that can dignify human nature. His lofs in public and private will be feverely felt. The uprightness of his actions in his public capacity is too well known to need the teftimony of an individual; and in private life, thofe who were fo happy as to know him beft, daily faw in him the kind indulgent hufband, the tender affectionate father, the firm and faithful friend. The benevolence of his mind fhone conspicuous in every action of his life. He lived adored by his family, beloved, efteemed, admired by his numerous acquaintance. He died fincerely lamented by all; and to fum up his character in one fhort line, "The feat of every virtue was his heart!""

# Simon Metcalfe

Simon Metcalfe continued to trade around the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean for another 4 years. He was in Macao in 1791. In 1792 he purchased a small French brig at Port Louis, Isle of France, to serve as a tender to Eleanora. He named this brig Ino and appointed his younger son Robert to command her. When the Eleanora sank in the Indian Ocean in September 1792, Metcalfe took command of the Ino.

In 1794, Metcalfe visited Houston Stewart Channel, at the southern end of the Haida Gwaii, and anchored in Coyah's Sound. Friendly trading with the local Haida natives of Chief Koyah began. Metcalfe let a great number come aboard the Ino. The Haida took advantage of their superiority in numbers and attacked. Within a few minutes, and with no loss on the side of the natives, every man on board had been killed including Simon Metcalfe, save one who fled into the rigging. The natives ordered the man to come down, which he did. He was kept as a slave for about a year. Eventually he was ransomed to a visiting ship and taken to Hawaii where he told his story to John Young, who passed it on to other captains who visited the islands. The Ino was not the only ship captured by the Haida in 1794. The schooner Resolution, tender to the Boston ship Jefferson under captain Josiah Roberts, was seized by the Haida of Chief Cumshewa and, as with the Ino, all but one of the crew killed.

# Pachaiyappa Mudaliar

Pachaiyappa Mudaliar's health deteriorated rapidly and one such visit to Thanjavur in 1794 he fell ill at Kumbakonam and died at Tiruvaiyaru on 31 March 1794.

# Thomas Mudge (horologist)

In 1789 his wife, Abigail died. Thomas Mudge died at the home of his elder son, Thomas, at Newington Butts, south London on 14 November 1794. He was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street.

# Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle

# Jean-Rodolphe Perronet

He died on 27 February 1794 in Paris, aged 85. The street next to the site of the École des ponts et chaussées (delimiting Paris's 6th and 7th arrondissements) is now named after him and a statue of him has been erected on the northeast corner of the Île de Puteaux, at the foot of the pont de Neuilly (whose first stone version, built in 1772 and surviving until 1942, was his work).

French sculptor Adrien Étienne Gaudez created a monumental statue of Perronet that is erected at the northeast end of Puteaux Island on the Seine River near Paris.

# Thomas Polk

Polk died at his Charlotte home on January 25, 1794, and was buried in what is now known as the Old Settlers' Cemetery in Charlotte.

# Theodosia Bartow Prevost

Theodosia and Burr moved to New York City in 1783, moving to Broadway in 1790 as Burr's legal career took off. This increase in work led to him travelling more, but their "intellectual partnership" did not suffer: the two wrote letters back and forth notable for their candour, with Theodosia constantly disagreeing with her husband's views, "never shy to point out his flaws", and Burr treating her as he would any other intelligent person, sending her political books and newspapers on a regular basis that he thought she would enjoy. Theodosia's keen sense of observation and adeptness at "judging [Burr's] peers on the national scene" made her a crucial ally in his political career, particularly after he joined the United States Senate in 1791.

Both Theodosia and Burr had a "passionate commitment to education" and Theodosia educated her daughter as any wealthy male child would have been: she could read and write at 3, studied Latin, Greek and French, and had read Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by age 10. Burr handled more and more of this as Theodosia's health began to deteriorate. Her illness was not a shock – she had been ill as long as they had known each other – but by 1792 she was in regular pain, with doctors' prescriptions doing little to help. Burr offered to resign from the Senate to spend more time with her, but she refused to allow it, and she finally died on May 28, 1794. She was buried in the now defunct St. John's Burying Ground, which was associated with Trinity Church.  Burr later wrote that she was "the best woman and finest lady" he had ever known.

# Bowes Reed

Reed died on July 20, 1794 at the age of 53. The executors of his will were his brother-in-law Charles Pettit and his son-in-law Joseph McIlvaine; Joseph Bloomfield, later Governor of New Jersey, was one of the witnesses. Reed is buried in Saint Mary's Episcopal Churchyard in Burlington.

# Guillaume Repin

During the French Revolution, on June 17, 1792, he was arrested and kept at a prison workshop. He was released by The Vendee on 17 June 1793. He was arrested again on December 24, 1793, in Mauges and taken to prison to Chalonnes-sur-Loire. He was sentenced to the guillotine and executed by the order of the Revolutionary Committee of Angers.

# Augustin Robespierre

Augustin was with his brother in the hall of the Convention on the day of 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794), when the deputies voted for the arrest of Robespierre, Saint-Just and Couthon after a heated discussion. Then Augustin rose from his place on the benches and said "I am as guilty as him; I share his virtues, I want to share his fate. I ask also to be charged". He was joined by Lebas. The five were kept under guard in the rooms of the Committee of General Security, where they remained until a place could be found for them.  Hearing of the arrests, the Commune of Paris issued orders to all prisons in the city, forbidding them to take any prisoner in, sent by the Convention. Augustin was taken to the prison of La Force while Maximilien was taken to the Luxembourg. Because of the Commune's orders, they were soon released and made their way to the Hôtel de Ville. Escorted by two municipal officers Augustin was the first to arrive. There they spent the evening vainly trying to coordinate an insurrection. In the early morning of 10 Thermidor, the forces of the Convention under Barras burst in and succeeded in taking most of them alive, except Lebas, who had shot himself.

In order to avoid capture, Augustin Robespierre took off his shoes and jumped from a ledge. He landed on the steps or on some bayonets resulting in a pelvic fracture and several serious head contusions, in an alarming state of "weakness and anxiety". Barras ordered that Augustin to be carried back to the rooms of the Committee of General Security. After a couple of hours the prisoners were taken to the Conciergerie prison; four of them were lying on stretchers. In a summary trial at the Revolutionary Tribunal Augustin declared that neither he nor his brother had, for one instant, fallen short in their duty to the Convention. In the early afternoon, the twenty-two convicts were sent to the scaffold on Place de la Révolution. Couthon was the second of the prisoners to be executed, with Augustin as the third, Hanriot as the nineth and Maximilien as the tenth.

# Jacques Roux

On January 14, 1794, Roux was informed that his case was going to be tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal. Upon hearing this news, Roux pulled out a knife and stabbed himself several times, but failed to land a fatal blow. Less than a month later, on February 10, 1794 while recovering in prison, Roux stabbed himself again, this time succeeding in killing himself. He was 41.

As the Enragés movement began falling apart, Jacques Hébert's more moderate left-wing faction known as the Hébertists tried to win over his former supporters and continue where he had left off.

# Robert Sayer

On his death, Sayer's business was taken over by Robert Laurie and James Whittle, both of whom had worked for him.

# Gregory Skovoroda

Three days before he died, he went to the house of one of his closest friends and told him he had come to stay permanently. Every day he left the house early with a shovel, and it turned out that he spent three days digging his own grave. On the third day, he ate dinner, stood up and said, "my time has come." He went into the next room, lay down, and died. He requested the following epitaph to be placed on his tombstone:

He died on November 9, 1794 in the village called Pan-Ivanivka (today is Skovorodinovka, Zolochiv district, Kharkiv region)

# Samuel Spencer (North Carolina)

Spencer died in 1794 while resting at his home on Smith's Creek in Anson County under unusual circumstances.  "It is reported that he had not been well and between court sessions was resting at his home. While sitting on the porch, with a red cap on his head, he became sleepy and began to nod; a large turkey gobbler apparently regarded the moving cap as a challenge and attacked. The justice was thrown from his chair and suffered numerous scratches from which erysipelas developed."

Samuel Spencer's life is detailed as one of three leaders for the Bill of Rights in North Carolina by Albert Coates.

# Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben

Von Steuben died on November 28, 1794, at his estate in Oneida County, and was buried in a grove at what became the Steuben Memorial State Historic Site. The estate became part of the town of Steuben, New York, which was named for him.

Steuben did not marry and had no children. He did not care much for his European relatives. Thus, he left his estate to his companions and aides-de-camp, Captain Benjamin Walker and Major General William North, with whom he had had an "extraordinarily intense emotional relationship ... treating them as surrogate sons."

# Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve

Pétion was elected to the Convention for Eure-et-Loir and became its first president. After his election he stood down as Mayor of Paris and Nicolas Chambon de Montaux was elected to replace him.  LP Manuel proposed that the president of the Assembly should have the same authority as the president of the United States; his proposition was at once rejected, but Pétion got the nickname of "Roi Pétion," which contributed to his fall. With disagreements over such items as the necessity of the September Massacres, the Convention was a scene of large-scale political infighting between different factions. The Girondins represented the moderate Right in the Convention while their more radical opponents, the Montagnards, represented the Left and were distinguished by their preference for occupying the higher rows of benches in the Convention. His jealousy of Robespierre allied him to the Girondin party, with which he voted for the king's death and for the appeal to the people. He participated to the Constitution Committee that drafted the Girondin constitutional project. He was elected in March 1793 to the first Committee of Public Safety; and he attacked Robespierre, who had accused him of having known and having kept secret Dumouriez's project of treason.

Pétion's name was among those of the twenty-two Girondin deputies proscribed on 2 June 1793 (see Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793). Pétion was one of those who escaped to Caen and raised the standard of provincial insurrection against the Convention; and, when the Norman rising failed, he fled with Marguerite-Élie Guadet, François Nicolas Leonard Buzot, Charles Jean Marie Barbaroux, Jean-Baptiste Salle [fr] and Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvrai to the Gironde, where they were sheltered by a wigmaker of Saint Emilion. At last, a month before Robespierre's fall in June 1794, the escaped deputies felt themselves no longer safe, and deserted their asylum; Louvet found his way to Paris, Salle and Guadet to Bordeaux, where they were soon taken; Barbaroux was guillotined after a botched suicide attempt; and the bodies of Pétion and Buzot, who had killed themselves, were found in a field, half eaten by wolves.

A. Dauban (Paris, 1866); Œuvres du Pétion (3 vols., 1792); FA Aulard, Les Orateurs de la Constituante (Paris, 1882).

# John Witherspoon

Witherspoon suffered eye injuries and was blind by 1792. He died in 1794 on his farm Tusculum, just outside Princeton, and is buried along Presidents Row in Princeton Cemetery. An inventory of Witherspoon's possessions taken at his death included "two slaves ... valued at a hundred dollars each".

# Yemmerrawanne

In September 1793, Yemmerrawanne was ill and reportedly appeared "much emaciated". The following month he injured his leg, and his health continued to deteriorate. Both Aboriginal men were moved to Eltham, where Yemmerrawanne was treated by the physician Gilbert Blane. His illness persisted, despite a variety of treatments, and Yemmerrawanne died on 18 May 1794, aged about 19, from a lung infection. He was buried in the local churchyard.

There have been several campaigns, including plans by Burnum Burnum and Geoffrey Robertson, to return Yemmerrawanne's remains to Australia, but the current location of his remains is unknown. The gravestone's location is known, but it has been moved several times since his burial.
