# Charles Fane, 2nd Viscount Fane

Sometimes referred to as Charles Lord Viscount Fane and before that as Hon. Charles Fane, he died without issue and was buried at Lower Basildon, Berkshire, 31 January 1766. His estates, after considering his widow, were divided between his surviving sisters, Mary, wife to Jerome de Salis, and Dorothy wife of John, fourth Earl of Sandwich.

The mansion house and estate at Basildon was sold to the Nabob, Sir Francis Sykes, 1st Baronet, and the great house was replaced by a bijoux Palladian villa, Basildon Park. His mother's renowned grotto down the hill at the Thames-side New House soon disappeared, though the house still stands. The lands in Armagh and Limerick were retained. They were finally partitioned in 1806.

Fane is in two of the monumental hunting scenes by John Wootton in the Hall at Althorp. They were commissioned by Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough and fifth Earl of Sunderland in 1733/34. When Lord Sunderland's youngest brother hon. Jack Spencer died in 1746, their old school friend Fane became guardian of the son, the future 1st Earl Spencer.

# Frederick V of Denmark

In 1760 Frederick broke his leg in a drunken accident, which greatly weakened him. According to Dorothea Biehl's statements the king was often seen in a condition "where his arm was not strong enough to bring his hat on his head again without Moltke's help." The king died at the age of forty-two, after a twenty-year reign. He had been a pleasant change compared to the pious Christian VI's autocracy, and when Frederick died there were many who mourned. His last words were reportedly: "It is a great consolation to me in my last hour that I have never wilfully offended anyone, and that there is not a drop of blood on my hands."

King Frederick V is interred in Roskilde Cathedral next to Queen Louise.

# Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin

Without living male heirs, the earldom of Godolphin, viscountcy of Rialton and barony of Godolphin of Rialton became extinct. The last devolved on his cousin Francis Godolphin, 2nd Baron Godolphin of Helston.

# Robert Grace

# Malhar Rao Holkar

He died at Alampur, 20 May 1766. His only son Khanderao Holkar had already died in 1754 during the seize of Kumher against the Jat maharaja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur State. After his son Kanderao's death in 1754, Malhar Rao prevented his wife Ahilya Bai Holkar from committing sati. Malhar Rao's grandson and Khanderao's young son Male Rao Holkar became the ruler of Indore in 1766, under the regentship of Ahilyabai, but he too died within few months in 1767. Ahilyabai became the ruler of Indore after the death of her only son with Khanderao. He is considered as one of the architects of Maratha control over India.

His daughter-in-law Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar built his samadhi Chhatri, at the spot of his cremation, at Alampur of Lahar in Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh state.

Stanisław was still alive when his great-great-granddaughter, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, was born in 1762. In his last years, his close friend, the Hungarian-born Marshal of France Ladislas Ignace de Bercheny lived on his estate to provide company.

Leszczyński died in 1766, aged 88 as a result of serious burns – his silk attire caught fire from a spark while the King was snoozing near the fireplace in his palace in Lunéville. He was medically treated for several days but died of wounds on 23 February. He was the longest living Polish king.

Najabat Ali Khan, Nazim-ud-din's brother, according to Mohammedan law was the right successor of the late Nawab, on the throne.

# Joseph Royle

Royle died January 26, 1766. He directed in his will that in the event his sons (William and Hunter), the heirs of his estate proved to be childless, the estate funds should be used to create a children's school to be called "Royle's Free School". He wanted the school to employ a teacher of good character, who would be paid £50 per year. This teacher should have the capability of teaching English, arithmetic and mathematics.  The school-house was to be built on any part of lots 266 and 267, a section of land inherited by his son William.

# Nicholas Sheehy

On 12 March 1766, Sheehy was tried at Clonmel Main Guard for being an accessory in the murder of John Bridge. The judge Richard Clayton (Irish judge) had the reputation of an honest and humane man, but he had arrived in Ireland only the previous year and seems to have been quite unaware of the political background to the trial.

Many of the witnesses who had previously testified against Sheehy also testified in this trial, in addition to Mrs. Mary Brady (Moll Dunlea), an "abandoned character". The evidence was widely considered as fabricated by local Anglo-Irish landowners and the Anglican Vicar of Clogheen in south County Tipperary.

Evidence was presented in favour of Sheehy, that he was "a respectable man and a man of property" by a Mr Keating, who said that Father Sheehy was in his house at the time of the murder. Mr Keating's testimony was dismissed in court by a Protestant clergyman (Mr Hewitson), who declared Keating was unreliable. Mr Keating was then arrested and sent to Kilkenny Gaol based on Mr Hewitson's allegations to frustrate his giving evidence. Although the judge was later much criticised for his conduct of the trial, it has been argued that his summing up was actually favourable to the accused.

Sheehy was convicted and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He asserted his innocence before his death of all the charges made against him. He said in his final speech, after sentenced to death, that he was being put to death for a crime which had never been committed; the murder victim (John Bridge) was alleged to be in Cork after the date of the "crime" and it is thought that he emigrated to Newfoundland.

Sheehy's attorney, on hearing the sentence of death, said to the judge, magistrates and jurors, "If there is any justice in heaven, you will die roaring.".

# James Francis Edward Stuart

James died in Rome on 1 January 1766 in his home, the Palazzo Muti, and was buried in the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica in present-day Vatican City.

His claimed reign had lasted for 64 years, 3 months and 16 days, longer than any British monarch until Queen Elizabeth II's reign surpassed it on 23 May 2016.

# Hoifa-Nara, the Step Empress

The Step Empress died on the 7th month of the 31st year of Qianlong.[j] However, the exact date of her death is a matter of debate. The Draft History of Qing, which has accuracy and reliability concerns, stated that she died on the Jiawu,[k] while modern works have listed her death as having happened on the 14th day of the 7th month.[l]

The Step Empress was already seriously ill on the 6th month of that same year.,[m] but Qianlong did not otherwise delay a trip to the summer residence in Chengde.

At the time of the Step Empress's death, Qianlong was on an annual hunting excursion at the Mulan Hunting Grounds (木蘭圍場, in the present-day Weichang Manchu and Mongol Autonomous County). He did not end his excursion immediately and head back to the Forbidden City. Instead, he ordered his 12th son, Yongji, to return to the palace to handle the funerary affairs.

By the Qianlong Emperor's order, The Step Empress's funeral was treated as that of an Imperial Noble Consort. but in reality, the ceremony was a much more scaled down affair, with the cancellation of imperial cabinet meetings for five days not carried out, and the cancellation of requirements for princesses, nobles, and high-ranking court officials to attend the mourning sessions. In addition, the casket used for the Step Empress is of a much lower quality. For her burial, the Step Empress was laid to rest in the Yu Mausoleum of the Eastern Qing tombs, next to Imperial Noble Consort Chunhui, instead of being laid to rest next to the Emperor's future resting place.

# Thomas Wotton (genealogist)
