  The Death of Joseph Bara (1794) by a pupil of Jacques-Louis David


  La Mort de Bara by Charles Moreau-Vauthier (1857–1924)


Bara was in fact too young to join the army, but attached himself to a unit fighting counter revolutionaries in Vendée. After his death General J.-B. Desmarres gave this account, by letter, to the Convention. "Yesterday this courageous youth, surrounded by brigands, chose to perish rather than give them the two horses he was leading." 

The boy's death was seized on as a propaganda opportunity by Maximilien Robespierre, who praised him at the Convention's tribune saying that "only the French have thirteen-year-old heroes". But rather than simply being killed by Breton royalists who solely wanted to steal horses, Bara was transformed into a figure who denied the Ancien Régime at the cost of death. His story became that having been trapped by the enemy and being ordered to cry "Vive le Roi" ("Long live the King") to save his own life, he preferred instead to die crying "Vive la République" ("Long live the Republic").

His remains were to be transferred to the Panthéon during a revolutionary festival in his honor but the event was cancelled when Robespierre was overthrown the day before it was to take place.

# Marie-Anne Barbel

In May 1745, Louis Fornel fell ill. He died soon after on May 30, 1745.

Marie was granted control of roughly half of Louis' property as well as control of his business ventures. This division of property was dictated under the Custom of Paris which served as the legal framework for most of France's overseas colonies beginning in 1454. As the Custom dictated, Marie-Anne was entitled to one half of the couple's Communaute des biens (community of property), the rest going to child heirs.

# Richard Barry, 7th Earl of Barrymore

Barrymore retired to life in the Royal Berkshire Militia, into which he had been commissioned in 1789 and was later promoted Captain, but was accidentally killed at Folkestone on 6 March 1793. When driving a gig his musket discharged while escorting French prisoners of war to Dover.

He was buried 17 May 1793 in St Mary's Church in Wargrave.

# John Berridge

Unlike some Methodists, Berridge never married, and lived alone. He wrote that there was “no trap so mischievous to the field-preacher as wedlock; and it is laid for him at every hedge corner.”  He had he had no relatives or connections within traveling distance. 

Not only was Berridge not married, he advocated clerical celibacy giving as his biblical authority Jeremiah 16:2 in which God told Jeremiah, a fellow-preacher, “you must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.”

In January 1793, Berridge became unable to travel and suffered a terminal asthmatic illness. He died in his vicarage in Everton on 22 January. Charles Simeon of Cambridge preached the funeral sermon on 27 January in Everton churchyard. “An immense concourse of people assembled from all parts of the country” for the funeral. Six clergymen acted as pallbearers.

# Jacques Cathelineau

  Arms of the Cathelineau family


After passing Angers on 23 June 1793 without difficulty, the combined Catholic and Royal Army led the storming of Nantes on 29 June. Cathelineau appeared before the city of Nantes at the head of 40,000 men, while Charette assisted him with 10,000 insurgents from Retz and Bas-Poitou. Cathelineau had entered the town in spite of the resistance of General Jean-Baptiste Canclaux and attacked the gate of Rennes. While penetrating Place Viarme, he was fatally wounded by a sniper from a window. With their leader incapacitated, the Vendéan army was defeated and soon divided into factions. He was transported to Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, where he died of his wounds on 14 July 1793. His body lies in the Cathelineau Chapel in Saint-Florent.

Numerous relatives of Cathelineau also perished in the war of Vendée and the reprisals that followed. The remainder of his family was ennobled under the Bourbon Restoration. His son Jacques-Joseph Cathelineau was knighted after the Restoration and his grand-son Henry Cathelineau was an officer during the Franco-Prussian War.
