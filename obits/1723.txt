# Luke de Beaulieu

He died 26 May 1723, aged 78, and was buried on the 30th at Whitchurch. His wife Priscilla was laid in the same grave 6 December 1728.

# Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon

In the midst of political turmoil, Queen Anne sent Cornbury as a replacement for Harley's emissary to her successor, George, Elector of Hannover (1660–1727; King 1714–1727). From his arrival in August 1714 until the Queen's death in November, Cornbury dined and spent his evenings with the royal family. "My Lord Clarendon is very much approved of at Court", wrote his secretary, John Gay.

Once King George I assumed the British throne, his animosity toward the Tories became apparent, and Cornbury lost his position as emissary. Cornbury continued to be active in the House of Lords until about 1720. He died on 31 March 1723 at Chelsea, London. He is interred in the Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey, in the Hdye family crypt.

# William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper

In his last years he was accused, but probably without reason, of active sympathy with the Jacobites. He died at his residence, Cole Green near Panshanger in Hertfordshire on 10 October 1723. Mary, who was devastated by his death, outlived him by only a few months.

# Thomas d'Urfey

He was buried on the day of his death at the fashionable church of St James's, Piccadilly in London. His lasting achievement lay in his best songs: 10 of the 68 songs in The Beggar's Opera were D'Urfey's.[citation needed]

# Nathan Gold

Gold died on October 3, 1723, and is interred at the Old Burying Ground, Fairfield, Fairfield County, Connecticut.
