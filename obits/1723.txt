# Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon

In the midst of political turmoil, Queen Anne sent Cornbury as a replacement for Harley's emissary to her successor, George, Elector of Hannover (1660–1727; King 1714–1727). From his arrival in August 1714 until the Queen's death in November, Cornbury dined and spent his evenings with the royal family. "My Lord Clarendon is very much approved of at Court", wrote his secretary, John Gay.

Once King George I assumed the British throne, his animosity toward the Tories became apparent, and Cornbury lost his position as emissary. Cornbury continued to be active in the House of Lords until about 1720. He died on 31 March 1723 at Chelsea, London. He is interred in the Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey, in the Hdye family crypt.

# William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper

In his last years he was accused, but probably without reason, of active sympathy with the Jacobites. He died at his residence, Cole Green near Panshanger in Hertfordshire on 10 October 1723. Mary, who was devastated by his death, outlived him by only a few months.

# Thomas d'Urfey

He was buried on the day of his death at the fashionable church of St James's, Piccadilly in London. His lasting achievement lay in his best songs: 10 of the 68 songs in The Beggar's Opera were D'Urfey's.[citation needed]

His widow was buried at Twickenham on 11 December 1729.

# Leopold Eberhard, Duke of Württemberg-Montbéliard

A major scandal erupted when in 1719, Leopold Eberhard arranged the marriage of his two surviving children from his first marriage with his Sandersleben adopted children, who are in all probability his own biological offspring; in addition, the Duke began to sought to have all of his children declared legitimate and apt to succeed him, despite the previously signed Wilbader Treaty (18 May 1715) with his kinsman Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg, were he recognized that he never married according to the family laws and that none of his children had any succession rights. In 1721, Leopold Eberhard asked the Emperor the recognition of his second marriage and the title of Hereditary Prince of Montbéliard for his oldest surviving son Count George Leopold of Sponeck, but his efforts were unsuccessful. 

Leopold Eberhard died on 25 March 1723 aged 53 and was buried on 27 March at night without much ceremony in the crypt of the Church of Saint-Maimbœuf of Montbéliard.

The Duke's children Count Georg Leopold of Sponeck as well as the Barons de l'Espérance sued, but their claims were rejected by the Reichshofrat on 8 April 1723, which said that "according to the known laws and customs of Germany and the family compact of 1617, the children were unable to inherit to the princely dignity and to succeed to the immediate imperial estates and fiefs". The children then took the dispute to French courts, which sequestered the estates in Mömpelgard (Montbéliard). Finally the French courts rejected their claims in 1747 and in 1748 the duke of Würtemberg came into possession of Mömpelgard.  The dispute dragged on for years and the duke's descendants did not give in until 1761.

# George Lowther (pirate)

In 1722 he sailed to a secluded island called Blanquilla. However, before landing he was spotted by Walter Moore, commander of HMS Eagle. Lowther was able to escape to the island by slipping out his cabin window, along with a dozen crewmen; only four made it to shore. After an extensive search Lowther's body was found. He had shot himself in the head rather than be taken prisoner.

The Post-Boy newspaper dated 2 May 1724 suggests that Lowther did not die in 1723.  The newspaper reports:

"The last Letters from S. Christopher bring Advice, that on the 20th of February, the Eagle Sloop, h ted out from that Island, had brought in thither the Pyrate Sloop she had taken from Lowther, with twenty of the Men that were on board, (Lowther himself and many of the Crew having made their Escape) and it was believed that twelve or thirteen of them would be convicted of Pyracy, and that the others would be clear’d, as being forced into the said Pyrates Service."

# Thomas Mansel, 1st Baron Mansel

Mansel died on 10 December 1723 and was buried at Margam.  He and his wife had six children, including Robert Mansel (1695–1723), MP (who predeceased his father by a few months), Christopher Mansel, 3rd Baron Mansel and Bussy Mansel, 4th Baron Mansel.

# Increase Mather

In 1715, following the death of his wife Maria the previous year, he married Ann Cotton, widow of his nephew John.

Before his death, he took lodging at the retreat of Mineral Spring Pond to recover from his illness and drink from the famous healing waters of the springs from Spring Pond.

# Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany

On 22 September 1723 the Grand Duke experienced a two-hour-long fit of trembling. His condition steadily deteriorated. Cosimo was attended by the Papal nuncio and the Archbishop of Pisa on his death bed. The latter pronounced "that this Prince required little assistance in order to die well, for he had studied and cared for nothing else throughout the long course of his life, but to prepare himself for death." On 25 October 1723, six days before his death, Grand Duke Cosimo disseminated a final proclamation commanding that Tuscany shall stay independent; Anna Maria Luisa shall succeed uninhibited to Tuscany after Gian Gastone; the Grand Duke reserves the right to choose his successor, but these stanzas were completely ignored. Six days later, on All Hallow's Eve, he died.[citation needed]  He was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, the Medici necropolis.[citation needed]

Cosimo III left a Tuscany one of the poorest nations in Europe; the treasury empty and the people weary of religious bigotry, the state itself was reduced to a gaming chip in European affairs. Among his enduring edicts is the establishment of the Chianti wine region. Gian Gastone repealed Cosimo's Jewish persecution laws, and eased tariffs and customs. Cosimo's inability to uphold Tuscany's independence led to the succession of the House of Lorraine upon Gian Gastone's death in 1737.

# Jean-Antoine de Mesmes

Jean-Antoine de Mesmes died suddenly on 23 August 1723 at the age of 61. As he had no son, his youngest and only surviving brother Jean-Jacques, regnal name and number Jean-Jacques IV de Mesmes, the Maltese knight, succeeded him as the sixth and last comte d'Avaux. His younger daughter Henriette-Antoinette inherited Cramayel [fr].

# Sister María Justa de Jesús

Sister Maria Justa died in 1723. According to the chronicles of the time her body showed signs of sanctity, such as flexibility, pleasant fragrances and fluidity of her blood. After her death the Franciscan Order in the Canary Islands conducted a process of canonization that was later halted.

# John Smith (Chancellor of the Exchequer)

The Sydenham inheritance included the manors of Broadlands and Marston Magna.

# Thomas Watson-Wentworth

# Christopher Wren

The Wren family estate was at The Old Court House in the area of Hampton Court. He had been given a lease on the property by Queen Anne in lieu of salary arrears for building St Paul's. For convenience Wren also leased a house on St James's Street in London. According to a 19th-century legend, he would often go to London to pay unofficial visits to St Paul's, to check on the progress of "my greatest work". On one of these trips to London, at the age of ninety, he caught a chill which worsened over the next few days. On 25 February 1723 a servant who tried to awaken Wren from his nap found that he had died.

Wren was laid to rest on 5 March 1723. His remains were placed in the south-east corner of the crypt of St Paul's beside those of his daughter Jane, his sister Susan Holder, and her husband William. The plain stone plaque was written by Wren's eldest son and heir, Christopher Wren, Jr. The inscription, which is also inscribed in a circle of black marble on the main floor beneath the centre of the dome, reads:

which translates from Latin as:

His obituary was published in the Post Boy No. 5244 London 2 March 1723:

"The Curious and Entire Libraries of Sir Christopher Wren", and of his son, were auctioned by Langford and Cock at Mr Cock's in Covent Garden on 24–27 October 1748.

# Zanabazar


From 1691 to 1701 Qing armies battled the Dzungars for control of Mongolia. Zanabazar remained in China, wintering in Beijing and passing his summers with the Kangxi Emperor at Jehol (Chengde) as his spiritual mentor.  He returned to Khalkha Mongolia only once during this period, in 1699, to attend the funeral of his elder brother, Tüsheet Khan Chankhuundorj.  The Kangxi Emperor designated Zanabazar “Da Lama”, “Great Lama”, and invited him on his pilgrimage to Wutaishan in 1698. Under Zanabazar's tutelage, the intensity of the Kangxi Emperor's Buddhist devotion notably increased after 1701.
In 1697, Qing forces decisively defeated Galdan at the Battle of Jao Modo. At age 66, Zanabazar finally resettled in Khalkha Mongolia in 1701 to supervise restoration of the Erdene Zuu Monastery.  Over the next several years he oversaw the building of more Buddhist monasteries in Mongolia while travelling to Beijing annually to meet with the Qing Emperor. Upon receiving news of the Kangxi Emperor's death on December 20, 1722, Zanabazar immediately journeyed to Beijing to conduct Buddhist rites at Beijing's Yellow Monastery (Huang si 黃寺). Zanabazar died himself (poisoned, some believe, by the new emperor)  in Beijing only six weeks later, on February 18, 1723.  He was 88 years old. His body was embalmed, returned to Mongolia and mummified.  The Kangxi Emperor's son, the Yongzheng Emperor, ordered a Chinese-style monastery dedicated to Zanabazar's main tutelary deity, Maitreya, to be built at the place where the lama's traveling encampment had stood at the moment of his death.  He pledged 100,000 liang of silver to the monastery's construction, which was not completed until a year after his own death in 1736. Amarbayasgalant Monastery or “Monastery of Blessed Peace,” resembles Yongzheng's own Yonghe Palace in Beijing.  Zanabazar's body was finally laid to rest there in 1779.

In 1937, Amarbayasgalant Monastery was ransacked by Mongolian communists. Zanabazar's remains were allegedly removed and burned in the hills nearby.
