# Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford

  Portrait by Thomas Hudson, still hanging in Woburn Abbey


In the spring of 1735, the Duchess of Bedford started experiencing symptoms of what she believed was her third pregnancy. Whether or not her morning sickness was the result of a pregnancy is uncertain, but it soon became apparent that the Duchess had contracted tuberculosis. The illness progressed rapidly, and the Duchess was drastically losing rather than gaining weight. The Dowager Duchess insisted that her granddaughter be moved to Southampton House in Bloomsbury Square. She died there intestate on 27 September 1735, aged 25 and leaving no surviving issue.

The Duchess's grief-stricken grandmother reread and burned all the Duchess's letters, and accused her widower of being responsible for her death. Despite her "contempt for ostentatious piety" and "her religious doubts", the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough reportedly prostrated herself on the floor of Marlborough House in prayer upon the death of her favourite grandchild.[page needed] She had become estranged from all her surviving daughters, and the Duchess of Bedford was her only grandchild who never disappointed her. Lord Hervey, however, accused the Dowager Duchess of caring more about the return of her granddaughter's jewels, which she demanded back from the Duke even before the Duchess was buried. The Duchess of Bedford's lead-lined coffin was placed on a gun carriage and taken through the streets. She was buried on 9 October 1735 at Chenies, Buckinghamshire. Her death removed her grandmother's link with the Duke of Bedford, leading to a considerable diminishment in the latter's influence.

# John Birch (died 1735)

Birch died without issue by either wife on 6 October 1735.

# Sir William Courtenay, 2nd Baronet

Courtenay died on 6 October 1735. He directed his body to be buried in the north aisle of Powderham Church "near the monument there erected". He further desired "my executor (who was his nephew William Courtenay (died 1735) of Powderham)...to bestow and lay out the summe of fifty pounds in erecting a monument near the place of interrment in such manner as my executor shall think fit". No such monument survives. His children included:



William Courtenay, 1st Viscount Courtenay
Henry Reginald Courtenay, MP.
Eleanor Courtenay (died 1765) who married John Francis Basset (1714–1757) MP for Barnstaple in 1740–1741, of Heanton Court, Heanton Punchardon.


He left £10 each to his nieces Elizabeth, Mary, Lucy and Isabella Courtenay for mourning clothes. He also bequeathed them each the sum of £30 to buy a diamond ring each to be worn in his memory. He bequeathed to Sir William Courtenay his nephew the sum of £100 and also made him his residuary beneficiary.

In 1831 Courtenay was recognised as having been de jure 6th Earl of Devon.

# Paul Docminique

Docminique died aged 92 on 17 March 1735. He had three sons of whom one predeceased him, and a daughter who predeceased him. His son Charles Docminique was also MP for Gatton.

# Sir Charles Kemeys, 4th Baronet

Kemeys died unmarried on 29 January 1735. His estate passed to his sister, who married Sir John Tynte, 2nd Baronet of Halswell, Somerset. Their son Sir Charles Tynte, 5th Baronet was Tory MP for Monmouthshire   and Somerset.

# George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne

He died in London on 29 January 1735, his wife having predeceased him by a few days, and was buried with her in the Church of St Clement Danes on 3 February 1735. He left no male progeny, and thus at his death the Barony of Lansdowne became extinct. His Jacobite titles, such as they were, were inherited by his nephew Bernard Granville, son of his brother Bernard. The younger Bernard died in 1776, when the Jacobite peerages created on 3 November 1721 became extinct, while those created on 6 October 1721 passed to his heir male.
