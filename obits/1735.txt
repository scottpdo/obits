# Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford

In the spring of 1735, the Duchess of Bedford started experiencing symptoms of what she believed was her third pregnancy. Whether or not her morning sickness was the result of a pregnancy is uncertain, but it soon became apparent that the Duchess had contracted tuberculosis. The illness progressed rapidly, and the Duchess was drastically losing rather than gaining weight. The Dowager Duchess insisted that her granddaughter be moved to Southampton House in Bloomsbury Square. She died there intestate on 27 September 1735, aged 25 and leaving no surviving issue.

The Duchess's grief-stricken grandmother reread and burned all the Duchess's letters, and accused her widower of being responsible for her death. Despite her "contempt for ostentatious piety" and "her religious doubts", the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough reportedly prostrated herself on the floor of Marlborough House in prayer upon the death of her favourite grandchild.[page needed] She had become estranged from all her surviving daughters, and the Duchess of Bedford was her only grandchild who never disappointed her. Lord Hervey, however, accused the Dowager Duchess of caring more about the return of her granddaughter's jewels, which she demanded back from the Duke even before the Duchess was buried. The Duchess of Bedford's lead-lined coffin was placed on a gun carriage and taken through the streets. She was buried on 9 October 1735 at Chenies, Buckinghamshire. Her death removed her grandmother's link with the Duke of Bedford, leading to a considerable diminishment in the latter's influence.

# John Birch (died 1735)

Birch died without issue by either wife on 6 October 1735.

# Sir William Courtenay, 2nd Baronet

Courtenay died on 6 October 1735. He directed his body to be buried in the north aisle of Powderham Church "near the monument there erected". He further desired "my executor (who was his nephew William Courtenay (died 1735) of Powderham)...to bestow and lay out the summe of fifty pounds in erecting a monument near the place of interrment in such manner as my executor shall think fit". No such monument survives. His children included:

He left £10 each to his nieces Elizabeth, Mary, Lucy and Isabella Courtenay for mourning clothes. He also bequeathed them each the sum of £30 to buy a diamond ring each to be worn in his memory. He bequeathed to Sir William Courtenay his nephew the sum of £100 and also made him his residuary beneficiary.

In 1831 Courtenay was recognised as having been de jure 6th Earl of Devon.

# Paul Docminique

Docminique died aged 92 on 17 March 1735. He had three sons of whom one predeceased him, and a daughter who predeceased him. His son Charles Docminique was also MP for Gatton.

# Sir Charles Kemeys, 4th Baronet

Kemeys died unmarried on 29 January 1735. His estate passed to his sister, who married Sir John Tynte, 2nd Baronet of Halswell, Somerset. Their son Sir Charles Tynte, 5th Baronet was Tory MP for Monmouthshire   and Somerset.

# George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne

He died in London on 29 January 1735, his wife having predeceased him by a few days, and was buried with her in the Church of St Clement Danes on 3 February 1735. He left no male progeny, and thus at his death the Barony of Lansdowne became extinct. His Jacobite titles, such as they were, were inherited by his nephew Bernard Granville, son of his brother Bernard. The younger Bernard died in 1776, when the Jacobite peerages created on 3 November 1721 became extinct, while those created on 6 October 1721 passed to his heir male.

# George Pitt (died 1735)

Pitt died on 28 February 1735 and was buried at Stinsford in Dorset. He had four sons and five daughters by his second marriage. His son George inherited Strathfieldsaye.

# Richard Reynell (died 1735)

Reynell died in June 1735 at East Ogwell and was buried there on 14 June. The beneficiary of his will was his niece  Rebecca Whitrow, the wife of Joseph Taylor. Reynell had instructed that his estates be sold for her benefit, but her husband then purchased them as the absolute estate of inheritance, which he settled on his wife and son.

# Samuel Rolle (1669–1735)

He died on 28 February 1735 and was buried at Chittlehampton, in which church exists a mural monument, on the west wall of the south transept, inscribed as follows: 

On the monument is shown an escutcheon with the arms of Rolle in the centre of which is an escutcheon of pretence with the arms of Lovering: Argent, on a fesse wavy azure a lion passant or, which signifies that Dorothy Lovering was an heiress.

# Maria Clementina Sobieska

Her health was weakened by her ascetic life style and deteriorated as the years went by. Maria Clementina died at the early age of 32 on 18 January 1735. She was interred with full royal honors in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Pope Clement XII ordered that she have a state burial. Pope Benedict XIV commissioned Pietro Bracci (1700–1773) to sculpt a monument to her memory, which was erected in the Basilica.

# Edwin Stead

Edwin Stead was the grandson of Sir Edwyn Stede (sic), who had been knighted by Charles II. He inherited the family estate when he was still only eighteen and became a compulsive gambler, being a keen player of dice and cards in addition to cricket, but John Marshall's summary is that "he is said to have lost heavily at all". John Major wrote that Stead lived the "proverbial short life but a merry one". His recklessness caused him financial difficulties in 1723 and he was obliged to mortgage some of his land to settle his debts. Stead was, nevertheless, a "graceful loser" and Major asserts that "his nonchalance" gained him powerful friends including Frederick, Prince of Wales.

Stead's death on 28 August 1735 was reported in the Grub Street Journal on Thursday, 4 September 1735. The report says there were two accounts of his death: one that he died "near Charing Cross"; the other that he died "in Scotland Yard".

# Sudawadi

After the death of Phetracha, Suriyenthrathibodi, the secret son of King Narai and Princess Kusavadi of Chiangmai adopted by King Phetracha, stole the throne of Ayutthaya from Prince Khwan, son of King Phetracha and Princess Sisuphan. Princess Sudawadi and her son, Prince Tratnoi, moved out to live with her relatives. She lived peacefully and died in 1735 during the reign of King Borommakot.

# Yongzheng Emperor

The Yongzheng Emperor ruled the Qing Empire for 13 years before dying suddenly in 1735 at the age of 56. Legend holds that he was assassinated by Lü Siniang, a daughter or granddaughter of Lü Liuliang, whose family was executed for literary crimes against the Qing government. Another theory was that Lü Siniang was the Yongzheng Emperor's lover, and the real mother of the Qianlong Emperor, but he refused to let her become the empress. It is generally accepted that he died while reading court documents, and it is likely that his death was the result elixir poisoning from an overdose of the elixir of immortality he was consuming in the belief that it would prolong his life.

To prevent a succession crisis like he had faced, the Yongzheng Emperor was said to have ordered his third son Hongshi (an ally of Yinsi) to commit suicide. He also devised a system for his successors to choose their heirs in secret. He wrote his chosen successor's name on two scrolls, placed one scroll in a sealed box and had the box stored behind the stele in the Qianqing Palace. He kept the other copy with him or hid it. After his death, the officials would compare the scroll in the box with the copy he had kept. If they were deemed identical, the person whose name was on the paper would be the new emperor.

The Yongzheng Emperor was interred in the Western Qing tombs 120 kilometres (75 mi) southwest of Beijing, in the Tai (泰) mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Elhe Munggan). His fourth son Hongli, then still known as "Prince Bao (of the First Rank)", succeeded him as the Qianlong Emperor. The Qianlong Emperor rehabilitated many figures who had been purged during his father's reign, including restoring honours to many of his uncles who were formerly his father's rivals in the succession struggle.
