# Sir Henry Bunbury, 3rd Baronet

Bunbury died in 1733 and was buried in Stoke, Chester four days later. He was succeeded in the baronetcy successively by his sons Charles and William.  His daughter Isabella married General John Lee, and was mother of Continental General Charles Lee.

# Gabriel Cano de Aponte

As a soldier, Cano was an innovative horseman, and historians have documented Cano's "inclination for unbridled fun and equestrian exercises". On July 26, 1733, while he was participating in a game on horseback, Cano suffered an equestrian accident when he fell with his horse and was crushed by it. The sequence of events that caused his death three months later are unclear, but what is clear is that Cano was badly injured and never recovered, dying on November 11 of the same year.

It has been stated that a spinal lesion caused by the accident kept him bedridden for a period of three months, clear in reason and with intense pain, before his death. However, there is no evidence that conveys any typical sign associated to spinal injury following the accident. Therefore, it is possible that Cano suffered a complex pelvic ring fracture. The fact that he was prostrated, lucid, but suffered intense pain best sustains the hypothesis of a pelvic fracture. After the initial period, one of the most common causes of death resulting from a pelvic fracture is deep venous thrombosis with secondary pulmonary thrombo-embolism. This must have been the sequence of events that most probably caused Cano de Aponte's death.

# Christopher Rawlinson (antiquary)

He died unmarried and intestate on 8 January 1733 in Holborn Row, London and was buried in the abbey church of St Albans, Hertfordshire. His portrait, engraved by Joseph Nutting, with those of other members of his family, is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. His estates passed to his cousins, the issue of his father's sisters Anne and Katherine. Following his death the furniture of Carke Hall was sold by auction and his manuscripts were at the same time sold for a few pennies in bundles to the villagers.

# Richard Duke (1652–1733)

He died in 1733 without surviving progeny. By his will his heir became  Richard VII Duke (1688–1740) of Otterton, his second cousin once removed,  the second son of Richard Duke (born 1653) by his wife Isabella, the son and heir of Richard Duke (born 1627), the son and heir of Robert Duke (1600–1665), the younger brother of Richard IV Duke (1600–1653) of Otterton.

# Fatma Sultan (daughter of Ahmed III)

She died on 3 January 1733, and was buried in the New Mosque, Istanbul.

# George Garden (minister)

He died on 31 January 1733 (Scott's Fasti has wrongly 1723). It illustrates the spread of high church doctrine since the revolution among the Scottish episcopalians that he is called in his epitaph "sacerdos" (the Latin term for priest). He had fairly earned the praise awarded him of being "literis et pietate insignis".’ Besides his great edition of Forbes he was the author of the Queries and Protestation of the Scots Episcopal Clergy given in to the Committee of the General Assembly at Aberdeen June 1694, 4to, London, 1694; The Case of the Episcopal Clergy, pts. i. and ii. 4to, Edinburgh, 1703; and he is probably the George Garden of Aberdeen who contributed to the Philosophical Transactions of 1677 and 1693.

His Bourignianism, says George Grub doubtfully, was probably due to sheer weariness of the controversies wherewith his country had been so long distracted; moreover, his friend Henry Scougall had been in the habit of going to France as well as to Flanders for spiritual improvement. They may be called the Scottish Quietists. Garden's sermon preached at Scougall's funeral was printed first in 1726.

# Sir Robert Grierson, 1st Baronet

  Laird of Lag's Tomb, near Farthingwell


Grierson of Lag was a byword for evil among the common Presbyterian folk in Annandale, who gravely asserted that he, like the other persecutors of the Covenanters, had intimate dealings with the devil, and that he was "partly in hell" before his death, in evidence of which they told that his saliva burnt holes where it fell, and his feet put into cold water made it boil. Lag died, aged 77, at his town house in Dumfries on 31 December 1733, and was buried two days later in the Grierson family burial plot in Old Dunscore Churchyard, the cost of the funeral being £240 Scots. A story was told that on the night he died a chariot surrounded by thunder clouds swept his soul away to hell. Another described how the horses pulling his hearse to Dunscore churchyard died of exhaustion on the way and a black raven flew down and settled on the coffin, flying away only at the moment of burial. The antiquary Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe claimed that the story regarding the horses was in fact true, and that his grand-uncle Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, a nephew of Lag's, had both attended the funeral and supplied the horses which subsequently died. Whereas the Presbyterian martyrologists had listed the names of those shot at the hands of Lag's men, the tales that grew up after his death became more lurid, and in later years locals pointed out a spot on Halliday Hill, near Lag Tower, where the Laird was said to have rolled Covenanters downhill in a barrel filled with spikes.

Such stories may not be the stuff of scholarly history, but they vividly demonstrate the loathing and fear in which this man was held by those who were loyal to the National Covenant (1638) and the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) and who hoped, sometimes schemed and even at times took up arms against the Stuart monarchy to achieve religious freedom. A satirical chapbook poem known as Lag's Elegy, in which the Devil lamented the death of Lag, his "champion brave", was extremely popular in southern Scotland for around fifty years after his death.

Grierson eventually entered folk memory, and was the subject of a strange custom recorded in Galloway and Dumfriesshire in the 19th century. Alexander Fergusson, who published a biographical sketch of him in 1886, recalled that as late as the 1840s some families, including Fergusson's own, used to commemorate Lag's deeds yearly in November by getting someone to dress as the "Laird of Lag", a "beast as hideous as the ingenuity of the performer intrusted with the part could make it" and which was used to frighten the children of the household. The conventional "beast" walked on all fours and had a long snout made from a large wooden kitchen pestle, with which the performer would "smell out Covenanters under the sideboard and other likely places": Fergusson said that anything "more striking, not to say appalling, to young minds can hardly be imagined".

# Girolamo Grimaldi (1674–1733)

Baptized in Genoa on 15 November 1674, Grimaldi  graduated from the University of Avignon on 26 June 1705 with a law degree. Four years later, he was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest, on 7 April 1709, and was appointed Internuncio to Brussels.

On 5 October 1712 he was appointed titular Archbishop of Edessa in Osrhoëne and sent as Nuncio to Poland. In 1720 he became Nuncio to Austria

Ten years later, he was created a cardinal in the consistory of 2 October 1730 and appointed the papal legate for Bologna. In the following year 1731 he became Legate for the duchies of Parma and Piacenza.

In 1733, while travelling by sea from Naples to Genoa, he became ill. He was taken ashore at Ischia and died there on 18 November 1733. His body was taken to Genoa and buried in the church of San Filippo.

# John Hanger (banker)

Hanger died in 1733 aged 77. A marble memorial to the family exists in St Michael's Church, Bray, the details of which were documented by the architectural historian Peter Spokes in the Berkshire Archaeological Journal in 1939.
