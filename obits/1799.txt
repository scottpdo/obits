# Philip Affleck

Affleck retired from his seat on the Board of the Admiralty in 1796 and lived quietly and privately at his home in Bath. He died at his home on 21 December 1799. The Naval Chronicle said of him that he was "Universally respected as an officer, as a gentleman, and as a christian."

The Earl of Sandwich commented on Affleck that he was "very respectable and thoroughly right headed".

# Pierre Beaumarchais

While he was out of the country, Beaumarchais was falsely declared an émigré (a loyalist of the old regime) by his enemies. He spent two and a half years in exile, mostly in Germany, before his name was removed from the list of proscribed émigrés. He returned to Paris in 1796, where he lived out the remainder of his life in relative peace. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Boulevard Beaumarchais in Paris is named after him.
