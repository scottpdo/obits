# James Adair (serjeant-at-law)

Adair died suddenly at his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, on 21 July 1798. He was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground.

# Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)

Before being tried, Bache died on September 8, 1798, at the age of 29 from yellow fever during an epidemic; while Philadelphia's worst yellow fever epidemic was in 1793, the disease regularly visited the city. Bache was buried in the Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia. He is regarded as an early champion of freedom of speech and the First Amendment.

# Jeremy Belknap

Belknap died in Boston and was buried at the Granary Burying Ground. His remains were later re-interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Belknap County, New Hampshire, is named in his honor.

# Michael Gottlieb Birckner

His struggle for freedom of speech was not looked upon favorably in government circles. Nevertheless, he was appointed vicar of Vemmelev and Hammershøj on the 28 November, 1798, an appointment that would have meant the end of his poverty. But this royal grace came too late, his illness had become lethal and he died the 1st of December the same year. His contribution to Danish literature was first acknowledged after his death. His friends praised his character and 2100 subscribers signed up for the first edition of his collected works. Furthermore, they collected 2500 rigsdaler that was donated to his grieving widow and children.

# William Byron, 5th Baron Byron

Byron also outlived his grandson, a young man who, at the age of twenty-two, was killed by cannon fire in 1794 while fighting in Corsica.  The barony was then left to his great nephew, George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron, who became the 6th Baron Byron when Lord Byron died on 21 May 1798, at the age of seventy-five.  Upon his death, it is said that the great number of crickets he kept at Newstead left the estate in swarms. Lord Byron is buried in the Byron vault at Hucknall Torkard in Nottinghamshire.

# William Cabell (American Revolution)

William Cabell Sr. died in 1798 and was buried at Union Hill Cemetery in Wingina, Virginia. By the time of his death, he had distributed estates to various family members, who received an additional 30,000 acres in his will. Seven children survived Col. Cabell Sr. In addition to Samuel J. Cabell mentioned above, born the year of their marriage, Margaret Cabell bore William Cabell, Jr. (1759–1822), who served in the Continental Army, married the daughter of Virginia judge Paul Carrington and succeeded his father at "Union Hill," most of which became part of Nelson County during the division of 1808. Their two other sons included Landon Cabell(1765–1834) and Hector Cabell (1768–1807). Their three daughters all married well. Margaret married prominent Nelson County planter and merchant Robert Rives, and their son William Cabell Rives had a distinguished legal and diplomatic career. Paulina (1763–1845) married Maj. Edmund Read and after his death c. 1808 Rev. Nash LeGrand. Their youngest daughter Elizabeth (1774–1801) married her cousin William H. Cabell (1772–1853), son of Col. Nicholas Cabell (1750–1803) and who himself became governor of Virginia and, after her death, president of what later became the Virginia Supreme Court.

# Joshua Clayton

Clayton died at Mt. Pleasant in New Castle County after being stricken with yellow fever while at the United States Congress in Philadelphia. He was first buried at the Locust Grove Cemetery in Pencader Hundred, New Castle County. Later his remains were moved into the Bethel Church Cemetery at Chesapeake City, Maryland. They were moved again to an unknown location in 1965 upon a widening of the nearby Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.

Clayton's son, Thomas Clayton was a U.S. Senator, and his nephew, John M. Clayton was also a U.S. Senator as well as U.S. Secretary of State.  His great-grandson Henry Clayton built Woodside; listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

# James Dickey (United Irishmen)

Dickey was captured by the Sutherland fencibles on the Divis Mountain where he hid out. He was court-martialled and hanged at Corn Market, Belfast on 26 June 1798. Famously; before his hanging Dickey refused to wear a black hood saying to the hangman, "Sir, don't cover my face!" According to local legend he shouted, "Don't think gentlemen, I am ashamed to show my face among you, I am dying for my country!" He was 22 years old. His head was placed on a spike outside the market house.

# Rigas Feraios

He entered into communication with general Napoleon Bonaparte, to whom he sent a snuff-box made of the root of a Bay Laurel taken from a ruined temple of Apollo, and eventually he set out with a view to meeting the general of the Army of Italy in Venice. While traveling there, he was betrayed by Demetrios Oikonomos Kozanites, a Greek businessman, had his papers confiscated, and was arrested at Trieste by the Austrian authorities (an ally of the Ottoman Empire, Austria was concerned the French Revolution might provoke similar upheavals in its realm and later formed the Holy Alliance).

He was handed over with his accomplices to the Ottoman governor of Belgrade, where he was imprisoned and tortured. From Belgrade, he was to be sent to Constantinople to be sentenced by Sultan Selim III. While in transit, he and his five collaborators were strangled to prevent their being rescued by Rigas's friend Osman Pazvantoğlu. Their bodies were thrown into the Danube River.

His last words are reported as being: "I have sown a rich seed; the hour is coming when my country will reap its glorious fruits".

# John Fitch (inventor)

A life of continual failure, frustration and litigation wore Fitch down.  He began drinking heavily once he returned to Bardstown in 1797.  In the end, Fitch took his own life by ingesting an overdose of opium pills.  He died on July 2, 1798, at the age of 55, and was buried in Bardstown.

# Lord Edward FitzGerald

Lord Edward FitzGerald's social position made him the most important United Irish leader still at liberty. On 9 May a reward of £1,000 was offered by Dublin Castle for his apprehension. Since the arrests at Bond's, FitzGerald had been in hiding, but had twice visited his wife in disguise and was himself visited by his stepfather Ogilvie and his friend William Lawless; he generally observed less caution than his situation required. Meanwhile, the date for the rising was finally fixed for 23 May and FitzGerald awaited the day hiding in a house in Thomas Street, Dublin.

FitzGerald's hiding place was disclosed by a Catholic barrister and informer named Francis Magan and on 18 May  Major Henry Sirr led a military party to the house where Lord Edward was in bed suffering from a fever. Alerted by the commotion, he jumped out of bed and, ignoring the pleas of the arresting officers Captain William Bellingham Swan (later assistant town Major of Dublin) and Captain Daniel Frederick Ryan to surrender peacefully, FitzGerald stabbed Swan and mortally wounded Ryan with a dagger in a desperate attempt to escape. The weapon used by Lord Edward to defend himself was later stolen from Major Swan's house by Emma Lucretia Dobbin the daughter of Rev. William Dobbin and Catherine Coote. He was only secured after Major Sirr shot him in the shoulder. The scabbard reputedly used by Lord Edward Fitzgerald at his arrest in 1798 is held at Limerick Museum. 

He was conveyed to New Prison, Dublin where he was denied proper medical treatment.[citation needed] After a brief detention in Dublin Castle, he was taken to Newgate. Inflammation set into his wound. His wife, whom the government probably had enough evidence to convict of treason, fled the country before he died without seeing him again, but his brother Henry and his aunt Lady Louisa Conolly were allowed to see him in his last moments. At the age of 34 he died as the rebellion raged outside on 4 June 1798. He was buried the next day in the cemetery of St Werburgh's Church, Dublin. An Act of Attainder confiscating his property was passed as 38 Geo. 3 c. 77, but was eventually repealed in 1819.

# Luigi Galvani

Galvani actively investigated animal electricity until the end of his life. The  Cisalpine Republic, a French client state founded in 1797 after the French occupation of Northern Italy, required every university professor to swear loyalty to the new authority. Galvani, who disagreed with the social and political confusion, refused to swear loyalty, along with other colleagues. This led to the new authority depriving him of all his academic and public positions, which took every financial support away. Galvani died in Bologna, in his brother’s house, depressed and in poverty, on 4 December 1798.

Galvani's legacy includes:

# Casimir Goerck


According to Stokes, Goerck died on November 19, 1798, which roughly accords with Koeppel, who writes 
Cohen and Augustyn give December 11, 1798 for the date of Goerck's death.

# Heraclius II of Georgia

Yet, both Georgian kingdoms remained under heavy Persian tribute until Nader was assassinated in 1747. Teimuraz and Heraclius took advantage of the ensuing political instability in Persia to assert their independence and expelled Persian garrisons from all key positions in Georgia, including Tbilisi. In close cooperation with each other, they managed to prevent a new revolt by the Mukhranian supporters fomented by Ebrahim Khan, brother of Adel Shah, in 1748. They concluded an anti-Persian alliance with the khans of Azerbaijan who were particularly vulnerable to the aggression from Persian warlords and agreed to recognize Heraclius's supremacy in eastern Transcaucasia. In 1749, he occupied Yerevan, and in June 1751, Heraclius defeated a large army commanded by a pretender to the Persian throne and his former ally, Azat-Khan in the Battle of Kirkhbulakh. After these particular events, Heraclius could largely afford to ignore the changing situation to the south of the Aras River. In 1752, the Georgian kings sent a mission to Russia to request 3,000 Russian troops or a subsidy to enable them to hire Circassian mercenaries in order to invade Persia and install a pro-Russian government there. The embassy failed to yield any results, however, for the Russian court was preoccupied with European affairs.

# William Jennens

William died on 19 June 1798 and his body was interred in the family vault beside his father and mother.

He was described as Britain's richest man at the time of his death. His estate was said to be worth over £2 million (though it was probably closer to £1.1 million), producing an annual income of about £40,000. The Times of 20 July 1798 published a tabulated list of his worth as capital of £432,509 and annual interest of £119,415. He died without leaving a will and the subsequent legal proceedings took well over a century (one source indicates 130 years although there seems little doubt that the case started in 1798 and ended in 1915, i.e. about 117 years) without reaching a conclusion, the legal costs exhausting the Jennens inheritance in the process.

His obituary read:

The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle reported in 1798 that:

# Allen Jones (Continental Congress)

Allen Jones died on his plantation, Mount Gallant, near Roanoke Rapids, Northampton County, North Carolina, on November 10, 1798. Interment was in the private burial ground on his estate.

# Denis Maguire

Dr. Maguire died at Enniskillen, County Fermanagh on 23 December 1798 at the age of 77 and was succeeded as Bishop of Kilmore by Dr. Charles O'Reilly.  Dr. Maguire was buried in the cemetery attached to the Church of Saint Molaise on Devinish Island in Loch Erne, County Fermanagh, beside the graves of his brothers Bryan and James Maguire. His gravestone, a massive horizontal slab close to the south wall of the church, is still visible and reads

Dr. Maguire's portrait hangs on the walls of St. Patrick's College, Cavan.

# Infanta María Amalia of Spain (1779–1798)

To find a new groom for Maria Amalia of a royal rank in such a short period of time was not an easy affair; thus her parents decided to marry Maria Amalia to her uncle, Antonio Pascual, Infante of Spain, who was twenty-four years older than she was. Infante Antônio was thirty nine years old. Considered of very limited intelligence, his interests were gardening, agriculture and hunting. He had remained unmarried without responsibilities of any kind.

Maria Amalia married her uncle on 25 August 1795 at the Royal Palace of La Granja. It was a double wedding; at the same time her sister, 13-year-old Maria Luisa, married Luis, Prince of Parma, Maria Amalia's original intended groom. The two couples continued living at the Spanish royal court.

During the fall 1797, Maria Amalia became pregnant with her first child. On 20 July 1798 she went into labour. The delivery was complicated. The baby got stuck by the shoulders in the birth canal and the doctors were unable to extract him. After two days, the surgeon finally intervened. By then the baby, a boy, was dead.  While her son was buried at El Escorial, Maria Amalia suffered in agony. She had contracted an infection during the ordeal and she died on 22 July 1798. She was only nineteen-years-old.

# Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen

Maria Christina no longer exercised any political influence. After a stay in Münster during the winter of 1792-1793 she moved with the seriously ill Albert to his hometown Dresden. They lived harmoniously, but without their previous warm relationship, and therefore no longer had such an elaborate court. At the beginning of 1794 they learned that the Emperor would now give them financial support. After their permanent move to Vienna, Maria Christina and her husband lived in the palace of Count Emanuel Silva-Tarouca. In the future, Albert was mainly concerned in his art collection. After the rise of Napoleon, Maria Christina was deeply shocked when she knew about the military clashes and the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio (18 October 1797) between Napoleon and Francis II.

In 1797 Maria Christina, who had become melancholic, began to suffer from a stomach disease. She went to bathing in Teplitz in July 1797 and had a short-term improvement in her health, but soon suffered again with great pain. Due to the restructuring of the Augustinerbastei, she and her husband rented the Palais Kaunitz and moved there. After a new short recovery, Maria Christina became more and more sick in the middle of June 1798; after wrote to Albert a farewell letter in which she mentioned her deep and lifelong love for him, she died the following day on 24 June 1798 aged 56. She was buried in the Tuscan Vault of the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. Her heart was buried separately and is located in the Herzgruft, behind the Loreto Chapel in the Augustinian Church within the Hofburg Palace complex in Vienna.

After the death of his wife the deeply saddened Albert build for Maria Christina an impressive tombstone in the Augustinian church. In the ornaments of this tomb, a work of the famous neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova, were was notably seen that not a single Christian symbol can be displayed but several Freemasons motifs were shown. The flat wall pyramid contains a medallion of Maria Christinas and figures made on Carrara marble. It bears the inscription Uxori Optimae Albertus, implying a dedication from Albert to his excellent wife. In a book published in 1805 by Van de Vivere, which deals with the tomb of Canova and is also present in a German translation of the same year, it is clearly shown that the grave monument has arisen out of the Christian thought, although the impact of Enlightenment is noticeable. The funds and the interpretation of language of allegory Canova created the symbols and figures that in the thinking of antiquity found use and in the early Christian period, to mourn and to bury him a man's death. After his death in 1822, Albert was buried next to her and their daughter.

# Thomas Bryan Martin

As a Loyalist, Martin maintained a low profile following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. By 1778, the Virginia General Assembly had abolished quit-rents, but in recognition of Lord Fairfax's loyalty, the Northern Neck Proprietary was made an exception. Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration by the assembly, and despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies, he was accorded all the privileges of a Virginia citizen. Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, his will was recorded on March 5, 1782, and conveyed his title to the remnants of his American properties, including the Northern Neck Proprietary, to Martin's elder brother Reverend Denny Martin, who then assumed the surname and coat of arms of Fairfax. Lord Fairfax devised his property and title to Denny Martin on the condition that he apply to the Parliament of Great Britain for an act to authorize him to inherit the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Martin was appointed by his uncle, along with Gabriel Jones and Peter Hog, as an executor of his will and estate. Martin inherited the plantation Lord Fairfax had purchased from John Borden consisting of 600 acres (2.4 km2). Martin was also bequeathed the Greenway Court estate and "all the stock of cattle, sheep, hogs, implements of husbandry, household goods and furniture" there. Martin and his brothers Denny and Philip also inherited all Lord Fairfax's slaves. Martin's uncle and Lord Fairfax's brother Robert Fairfax appealed his claim to the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron to Parliament, and succeeded as the 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.

On account of his residency in England, Denny Fairfax appointed Martin and Jones as managers of the proprietary. Martin and Jones placed advertisements in newspapers petitioning proprietary tenants to bring their claims against the Lord Fairfax estate forward and prove them. The descendants of William Fairfax continued to assert back claims against the estates of Lord Fairfax, which had been rendered by William Fairfax prior to 1757. In order to absolve himself of these back claims, Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin and Jones, and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official transposition in London on September 21, 1784.

Because Denny Fairfax was a British subject residing in England, he had no legal rights under American jurisdiction; thus, he and his British relatives were considered "alien enemies" and his landholdings were confiscated under escheat laws. In 1785, the Virginia General Assembly ordered that all records, books, and documents pertaining to the proprietary's lands be confiscated by the state of Virginia and removed to the Virginia State Land Registrar's Office in Richmond. Virginia seized the remaining proprietary lands that had not yet been granted, and citizens that had already acquired grants from the proprietary were permitted to keep their land. Land values in the Northern Neck continued to increase in value, which Martin noted in a 1790 letter. The higher land prices caused many residents of the proprietary to sell their lands and relocate further into the frontier, which Martin commented: "The emigration of inhabitants is... astonishing."

# Joseph Mawbey

Mawbey then ceased to sit in parliament. He died at Botleys, 16 June 1798, and was buried in the family vault in the chancel of Chertsey Church, where his wife and several of his children had preceded him.

# William McCoy (mutineer)

McCoy discovered how to distill alcohol from the sweet syrup of the ti tree root. He, Matthew Quintal, and some of the women would lie around all day in a drunken stupor.  On 20 April 1798, while drunk, he killed himself by tying a stone to his neck and leaping off a cliff.

# Robert Merry

Regard for his family still kept his wife reluctantly from the stage; but when Wignell, of the New Theatre, Philadelphia, offered her an engagement in 1796, Merry, to whom life in London was becoming embarrassing, gave his consent, and in October they landed at New York. On 5 Dec. Mrs. Merry appeared in Philadelphia as Juliet, "perhaps the best Juliet", Dunlap thought, "that was ever seen or heard". She acted in New York next year, and afterwards in the chief cities of the union, everywhere leaving her American rivals behind. Merry himself, in 1797, brought out his drama, The Abbey of St. Augustine, at Philadelphia, but for the most part contented himself with the unofficial laureateship which the younger writers granted to his London reputation. In 1798 he was living in Baltimore and still clinging to his faith in the French Revolution. On 14 Dec., in the morning, while walking in his garden, he fell in an apoplectic fit, and three hours later was dead.

The Magician no Conjuror (with music by Joseph Mazzinghi) was performed at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in 1972.

# John Murphy (priest)

Eluding the crown forces by passing through the Scullogue Gap, Fr John Murphy and other leaders tried to spread the rebellion across the country by marching into Kilkenny and towards the midlands. On 26 June 1798 at the Battle of Kilcumney Hill in County Carlow, their forces were tricked and defeated. Fr Murphy and his bodyguard, James Gallagher, became separated from the main surviving group (fragments of which fought for six more years from the Killoughrim woods near Enniscorthy (James Corocoran) and from Wicklow mountains). Fr Murphy decided to head for the safety of a friend's house in Tullow, County Carlow, when the path cleared. They were sheltered by friends and strangers – one Protestant woman, asked by searching yeomen if any strangers had passed, answered "No strangers passed here today"; when she was later questioned about why she had not said Murphy and Gallagher had not passed, she explained that they had not – because they were still in her house when she was questioned.

After a few days, some yeomen captured Murphy and Gallagher in a farmyard on 2 July 1798. They were brought to Tullow later that day where they were brought before a military tribunal, charged with committing treason against the British crown, and sentenced to death. Both men were tortured in an attempt to extract more information from them. Fr Murphy was stripped, flogged, hanged, decapitated, his corpse burnt in a barrel of tar and his head impaled on a spike. This final gesture was meant to be a warning to all others who fought against the British Crown.

# Sir Robert Palk, 1st Baronet

Palk died at Haldon House on 29 April 1798, ten years after his wife. They were both buried in Dunchideock church.

# John Palmer (actor)

On 18 June 1798, the last night of the season at Drury Lane, Palmer played Father Philip in the Castle Spectre of "Monk" Lewis, and Comus, the former an original part, in which he had been first seen on the 14th of the previous December. He then went to Liverpool, and was in low spirits, bewailing the death of his wife and that of a favourite son. He was announced to play in the Stranger, but the performance was deferred.

On 2 Aug. 1798 he attempted this part. No support of his friends could cheer him. He went through two acts with great effect. In the third act he was much agitated, and in the fourth, at the question of Baron Steinfort relative to his children, he endeavoured to proceed, fell back, heaved a convulsive sigh, and died, the audience supposing, until the body was removed and the performance arrested, that he was merely playing his part. An attempt to reap a lesson from the incident was made by saying that his last words were, There is another and a better world. It was said, too, that this phrase, which occurs in the third act, was to be placed on his tomb. Whitfield, however, who played Steinfort, told Frederic Reynolds positively that Palmer fell in his presence, which is irreconcilable with this edifying version. A benefit for his children was at once held in Liverpool, an address by William Roscoe being spoken, and realised a considerable sum. A benefit at the Haymarket on 18 Aug. brought nearly £700; a third was given on 15 September, the opening night at Drury Lane, when the Stranger was repeated.

# Madeleine de Puisieux

On April 12, 1798, Madeleine de Puisieux died in her hometown in Paris at the age of 77 years old.

# Juan Nepomuceno de Quesada

He became ill in February 1796, and continued to serve as governor of East Florida only until March of that year, when he was succeeded by Bartolomé Morales. He died in 1798.

# George Read (American politician, born 1733)

Read died at New Castle on September 21, 1798, and is buried there in the Immanuel Episcopal Church Cemetery.

William T. Read in his Life and Correspondence described Read as "tall, slightly and gracefully formed, with pleasing features and lustrous brown eyes. His manners were dignified, bordering upon austerity, but courteous, and at times captivating. He commanded entire confidence, not only from his profound legal knowledge, sound judgment, and impartial decisions, but from his severe integrity and the purity of his private character." However, a fellow delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 noted that "his legal abilities are said to be very great, but his powers of oratory are fatiguing and tiresome to the last degree; his voice is feeble and his articulation so bad that few can have patience to attend him." Historians like John Monroe have generally recognized that all in all, Read was the dominating figure in Delaware politics during his career, directly or indirectly providing consistent and reliable leadership to the new state.

His home, Stonum, is now a historic landmark. On The Strand in New Castle is the house built by his son, George Read, II. It is owned by the Delaware Historical Society, restored and opened to the public. There is a school named for him in New Castle and a dorm at the University of Delaware.

# Thomas Sandby

Sandby died at the deputy ranger's lodge in Windsor Park on Monday, 25 June 1798, and was buried in the churchyard of Old Windsor.

# Tarrare

Four years later, in 1798, a M. Tessier of Versailles hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it. Percy, however, recognised that he had advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to experience continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.

The corpse rotted quickly; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, wanted to find out how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.

The fork was never found.

# Wolfe Tone

When the prisoners were landed a fortnight later, Sir George Hill recognised Tone in the French adjutant-general's uniform in Lord Cavans privy-quarters at Letterkenny. At his trial by court-martial in Dublin on 8 November 1798 Tone made a speech avowing his determined hostility to England and his intention "by frank and open war to procure the separation of the countries".
Recognising that the court was certain to convict him, he asked that "the court should adjudge me to die the death of a soldier, and that I may be shot". Reading from a prepared speech, he defended his view of a military separation from Britain (as had occurred in the fledgeling United States), he explained his motives:

A commentary on the trial continues: "After a long silence, interrupted by some expressions of admiration, he was told that his request should be submitted to the Lord-lieutenant.  Thinking, however, that there was but little prospect, he committed suicide in prison.  With Wolfe Tone, terminated the insurrection of 1798. He was the prime mover of it, and was its last victim…"

He also lamented the outbreak of mass violence, saying: "Such are my principles such has been my conduct; if in consequence of the measures in which I have been engaged misfortunes have been brought upon this country, I heartily lament it, but let it be remembered that it is now nearly four years since I have quit Ireland and consequently I have been personally concerned in none of them; if I am rightly informed very great atrocities have been committed on both sides, but that does not at all diminish my regret; for a fair and open war I was prepared; if that has degenerated into a system of assassination, massacre, and plunder I do again most sincerely lament it, and those few who know me personally will give me I am sure credit for the assertion."

To the people, he had the following to say from the dock:

His eloquence was in vain, and his request to be shot was denied. On 10 November 1798, he was found guilty and was sentenced to be hanged on 12 November. Before this sentence was carried out, either he attempted suicide by slitting his throat or British soldiers tortured and mortally wounded Tone. The story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage, and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would open and he would bleed to death. He responded by saying "I can yet find words to thank you sir; it is the most welcome news you could give me. What should I wish to live for?".

He was treated at the time of his death by military surgeon Benjamin Lentaigne who treated Tone just hours before he was due to be hanged. A pamphlet published in Latin by the doctor some years after Tone's official "suicide" refers to an unusual neck wound suffered by an unnamed patient which indicated that "a bullet passed through his throat". This has led to speculation that Tone may have been shot.

Theobald Wolfe Tone died on 19 November 1798 at the age of 35 in Provost's Prison, Dublin, not far from where he was born. He is buried in Bodenstown, Co. Kildare, near his birthplace at Sallins, and his grave is in the care of the National Graves Association.

In 1912 an annual commemoration march from Naas to Bodenstown was started by Tom Clarke, who was to be executed after the 1916 Rising. The march became a part of the folklore of Irish republican groups, with a new headstone placed in the 1940s. As a result Tone's grave was bombed at night by the Ulster Volunteer Force in 1971, and was then rebuilt.

# George Vancouver

Vancouver, at one time amongst Britain's greatest explorers and navigators, died in obscurity on 10 May 1798 at the age of 40, less than three years after completing his voyages and expeditions. No official cause of death was stated, as the medical records pertaining to Vancouver were destroyed; one doctor named John Naish claimed Vancouver died from kidney failure, while others believed it was a hyperthyroid condition. His grave is in the churchyard of St Peter's Church, Petersham, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England. The Hudson's Bay Company placed a memorial plaque in the church in 1841. His grave in Portland stone, renovated in the 1960s, is now Grade II listed in view of its historical associations.
