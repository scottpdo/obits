# William Beverley

After Beverley's death in 1756, his son Robert was his designated heir at law. His wife Elizabeth inherited his plantations in Essex County, including the Blandfield estate and his "slaves, cattle, horses, hogs, and sheep" on the plantations. Beverley divided a large part of his fortune among his children and their spouses, bequeathing £500 to his daughter Elizabeth and leaving her husband, James Mills, "Money & slaves" valued at £1,000. Ursula also received £500 and her husband, William Fitzhugh, £1,000. Anna was unmarried at the time of Beverley's death; his will instructed Robert to maintain his sister until her marriage or her twenty-first birthday, when she would receive her inheritance. Robert inherited the remainder of the plantations and other lands, including the Beverley Manor tract in Augusta County and lots in the town of Staunton. Beverley Manor, an Augusta County magisterial district south of Staunton, is a namesake of the Beverley Manor patent. After his mother's death Robert also inherited Beverley's Essex County properties, including Blandfield (where he built the present Georgian mansion on the site of his father's residence between 1769 and 1773). Blandfield was owned by Beverley's descendants until its 1983 sale.

# Josiah Cotton

Born in 1680 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, Josiah Cotton was the son of Jane (née Rossiter) and John Cotton Jr. (1639–1699), a prominent Indian missionary and son of John Cotton, a leading Puritan clergyman in New England. His father was the town's fourth minister and the eldest son and namesake of Boston's most venerable pastor and theologian. He had ministered to well-established communities of Native Christians on Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod. Virtually all of Cotton's uncles, brothers, and cousins pursued successful ministerial callings, while aunts and sisters married eminent country clergymen.

In 1698, Cotton graduated from Harvard College. 1698–1707, he served for several years as schoolmaster in the fishing community of Marblehead before returning to his native Plymouth. In 1707, he married Hannah Sturtevant, the only child of a prosperous Pilgrim family. He also petitioned the New England Company for an appointment.

In 1729, Governor Samuel Shute appointed him justice of the peace and quorum. As a civil magistrate, Judge Cotton rose to considerable heights, but in what he called his "Indian Business", the lay missionary labored in the long shadow cast by his father. From the start, however, Cotton's missionary enterprise was vulnerable. Unlike John Eliot, Experience Mayhew, and his own father, he had no settled pastorate. Instead, he spent the majority of this time preaching to isolated Indian families and indentured servants living in the midst of English society.

Mr. Cotton died in 1756, aged 76 years, leaving numerous progeny. His son John Cotton (1712–1789) succeeded his civil duties. Cotton possessed a strong and sound mind, was fervently pious, and was indefatigable in the discharge of all the duties of his various and honorable stations in life. He left a diary, which he began in his youth, soon after he left college, and continued nearly to the time of his decease. It was in the possession of his grandson, Rosseter Cotton, Register of Deeds for the county of Plymouth.

Cotton wrote a supplement to the New England Memorial and "Vocabulary of the Massachusetts (or Natick) Indian language", now in the hands of the Massachusetts Historical Society.

The able Dalawa breathed his last in the year 1756. Marthanda Varma was terribly saddened by his death, and finally followed his faithful servant in 1758.

# William Dicey
