# Anthony Askew

Askew died 28 February 1774 at Hampstead, London, England.[nb 8]

He was buried at Hampstead church. Henry Askew, Anthony's brother, became the caregiver for the orphaned children.

After the death of Askew, the library of nearly 7,000 books, was sold at an auction which lasted from 13 February to 7 March 1775. William Munk stated that the library collection was sold beginning 19 February 1775 by Baker and Leigh; the sale continued for 19 days. The catalogue of the collection was sold at one shilling and sixpence, with a few copies on royal paper at four shillings… The purchasers of Askew's books at the auction included the anatomist William Hunter, the British Museum and the kings of England and France. Books purchased by George III of England in 1762, and the Second Folio of Shakespeare bought in 1800, were added to the King's Library.

Askew's extensive collection of transcribed inscriptions is at the British Museum. One codex of his collection is named Askew Codex.

# Robert Rochfort, 1st Earl of Belvedere

Rochfort died on November 13, 1774 (1774-11-13) aged 66. The cause of his death is not clear but some speculated that occupants of a boat came ashore to Belvedere House after crossing Lough Ennell, and murdered Rochfort in the dead of the night while others state that while on a moonlit walk, he was attacked by wild dogs;  or he could have fallen and struck his head on a rock, and possibly bled to death.

# Henry Caldwell

Henry Caldwell died May 28, 1810 at his home, Belmont, near Quebec. His wife, Ann, died six years earlier. She was a daughter of Alexander Hamilton (d.1808) M.P., K.C., of Hampton Hall, Co. Dublin & Newtonhamilton, Co. Armagh. Her father represented Belfast in Parliament. Ann was the great aunt of Chief Justice Edward Bowen who came to Quebec with the Caldwells. Henry left all his personal goods and property to his only son, except for the seigneury of Lauson, which he bequeathed to his grandson Henry John Caldwell, and what was left of Sans Bruit, which went to his granddaughter Ann Caldwell; he also left various gifts to relatives and friends.

# Robert Clive

Clive left India for the last time in February 1767. In 1768, he lived for a time at the Chateau de Larzac in Pézenas in the Hérault département of the Languedoc-Roussillon region in southern France. Local tradition says that he was responsible for introducing the local pastry makers of Pézenas to a sweet pastry, Le petit pâté de Pézenas, the size and shape of a large cotton reel with a sweet centre, and that he (or, more likely, his chef) had brought the recipe from India as a refined version of the savoury keema naan. Pézenas is now known for these delicacies.

Later in 1768, Clive was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).

In 1769, he acquired the house and gardens at Claremont near Esher and commissioned Lancelot "Capability" Brown to remodel the garden and rebuild the house.

In 1772 Parliament opened an inquiry into the Company's practices in India. Clive's political opponents turned these hearings into attacks on Clive. Questioned about some of the large sums of money he had received while in India, Clive pointed out that they were not contrary to accepted company practice, and defended his behaviour by stating "I stand astonished at my own moderation" given opportunities for greater gain. The hearings highlighted the need for reform of the Company, and a vote to censure Clive for his actions failed. Later in 1772, Clive was appointed Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath (eight years after his knighthood had been awarded),[clarification needed] and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire.

There was a great famine in Bengal between 1769 and 1773, which reduced the population of Bengal by a third. It was argued that the activities and aggrandizement of company officials was to blame for the famine, particularly the abuse of monopoly rights on trade and land tax used for the personal benefit of company officials. These revelations and the subsequent debates in parliament reduced Clive's political fortunes considerably.[citation needed]

Clive continued to be involved in ongoing Parliamentary discussions on company reforms. During these, in 1773, General John Burgoyne, one of Clive's most vocal enemies, pressed the case that some of Clive's gains were made at the expense of the Company and the government. Clive again made a spirited defence of his actions, and closed his testimony by stating "Take my fortune, but save my honour."  The vote that followed completely exonerated Clive, who was commended for the "great and meritorious service" he rendered to the country. Immediately thereafter Parliament began debating the Regulating Act of 1773, which significantly reformed the East India Company's practices.

On 22 November 1774 Clive died, aged forty-nine, at his Berkeley Square home in London. There was no inquest on his death and it was variously alleged he had stabbed himself or cut his throat with a penknife or had taken an overdose of opium, while a few newspapers reported his death as due to an apoplectic fit or stroke. One 20th-century biographer, John Watney, concluded: "He did not die from a self-inflicted wound...He died of a heart attack brought on by an overdose of drugs". Though Clive's demise has been linked to his history of depression and to opium addiction, the likely immediate impetus was excruciating pain resulting from illness (he was known to suffer from gallstones) which he had been attempting to abate with opium. Shortly beforehand, he had been offered command of British forces in North America which he had turned down. He was buried in St Margaret's Parish Church at Moreton Say, near his birthplace in Shropshire.

Clive was awarded an Irish peerage in 1762, being created Baron Clive of Plassey, County Clare; he bought lands in County Limerick and County Clare, Ireland, naming part of his lands near Limerick City, Plassey. Following Irish independence, these lands became state property. In the 1970s a technical college, which later became the University of Limerick, was built at Plassey.

# Robert Fergusson

  The Burns epitaph on the poet's headstone in Edinburgh's Canongate Kirkyard


Fergusson's literary energy and active social life were latterly overshadowed by what may have been depression although there are likely to have been other factors. From around mid-1773 his surviving works appear to become more darkly melancholic. In late 1773, in his "Poem to the Memory of John Cunningham" which was written on hearing news of the death of that poet in an asylum in Newcastle, Fergusson expressed fears of a similar fate.

His fears were founded. Around the backend of the year 1774, after sustaining a head injury in circumstances that are obscure (he fell heavily down a flight of stairs in Edinburgh, according to his epitaph), Fergusson was submitted against his will into Edinburgh's Darien House "hospital" (close to today's eponymous Bedlam Theatre), where, after a matter of weeks, he suddenly died. He had only just turned 24. He was buried in an unmarked grave on the west side of the Canongate Kirkyard.

The poet Robert Burns privately commissioned and paid for a memorial headstone of his own design, which was erected in 1787. The stone was restored in April 1850 by the poet Robert Gilfillan. In the later nineteenth century, Robert Louis Stevenson intended to renovate the stone, but died before he could do so. The epitaph that Stevenson planned to add to the stone is recorded on a plaque added to the grave by the Saltire Society on the Society's 50th anniversary in 1995.

# Sir Henry Gough, 1st Baronet

Gough died on  8 June 1774 leaving six children by his second wife. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Henry, who became Henry Gough-Calthorpe upon his inheritance of his maternal uncle's lands in 1788 and was created 1st Baron Calthorpe in 1796.

Gough also had two daughters, Barbara and Charlotte Gough, also known as Gough-Calthorpe. The former (c. 1745 – 1826) married in 1770 Isaac Spooner, a wealthy Birmingham businessman, and bore ten children, including Barbara Spooner, who married abolitionist William Wilberforce, and Anne Spooner (1780–1873), who married in 1809 The Rev. Edward Vansittart Neale, Rector of Taplow in Buckinghamshire, and had eight children, including Edward Vansittart Neale, one of the Founders of the Co-Operative Society, and Charlotte Vansittart Neale (1817–1881), married in 1841 to Charles Frere, a barrister and parliamentary clerk, by whom she had nine children, one of which, Charlotte Vansittart Frere (1846–1916), married in 1882 artist and writer A. G. Folliott-Stokes of St Ives, author of several important books on Cornwall, and had issue. The latter married Sir John Palmer, 5th Baronet, who was MP for Leicestershire from 1765 to 1780.

# Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet

Johnson died from a stroke at Johnson Hall on 11 July 1774 during an Indian conference. Guy Johnson, William's nephew and son-in-law (he had married Mary/Polly), reported that Johnson died when he was "seized of a suffocation." His funeral in Johnstown was attended by more than 2,000 people. His pallbearers included Governor William Franklin of New Jersey and the justices of the New York Supreme Court. He was buried beneath the altar in St. John's Episcopal church, the church he founded in Johnstown. The next day chiefs of the Six Nations performed the traditional Iroquois condolence ceremony, and recognised Guy Johnson as Sir William's successor.

During the American Revolution, the rebel New York legislature seized all of Johnson's lands and property, as his heirs were Loyalists. In 1960 Johnson Hall was named a National Historic Landmark. It is a designated State Historic Site and open to the public.

Johnson's most important legacy is the comparatively peaceful co-existence of Anglo-Americans and Indians during his tenure as Indian Agent for British North America. As an adopted Mohawk chief and husband, according to Iroquois law, of Mohawk Mary Brant, he was a trusted counselor and member of Mohawk nation and, through that affiliation, the Five Nations of the Iroquois. That position gave him standing not only to lead Iroquois into battle on the side of the English, but also to negotiate two treaties of Fort Stanwix, modern day Rome, New York. While the treaties deprived many Indians of land without their knowledge, they gave favourable terms to the Iroquois, and resulted in decades of comparative peace between traditional Indian residents and new settlers.

Co-existence was part of Johnson's other major historical legacy: the protection of British sovereignty and Anglo-American settlement as a bulwark against French control of northern New York State and the Great Lakes region more generally. Johnson was instrumental in sustaining British-Iroquois alliance through the Covenant Chain, which consolidated both Iroquois and British territorial and commercial interests against the rival Algonquin and French interests in New France before 1763. After Britain assumed control, Johnson eventually won a political dispute over Indian policy with Lord Jeffery Amherst, who disdained the Iroquois alliance Johnson had so devoted himself to nurturing and defending. It was to Johnson that Pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him.



  Old Fort Johnson


  Guy Park manor


Old Fort Johnson, his first home built in 1749, is on the Historic American Buildings Survey. It is currently the home of the Montgomery County Historical Society, which operates a museum, gift shop, and holds events. Guy Park Manor, built in 1773, for Sir William's daughter Mary (Polly) and her husband, his nephew Guy Johnson, is also open to the public.

# Louis XV of France

  Madame de Pompadour by François-Hubert Drouais (1763–64)


The winter of 1763–64 was particularly harsh; Madame de Pompadour contracted pneumonia, and died on 15 April. The King was deeply affected, but, strictly observing court protocol, he did not attend her funeral, because she was too far below his rank, and, though mourning, carried on court business as usual.   Maneuvering immediately began within the court to replace Madame de Pompadour; a leading candidate was Duchess of Gramont, the sister of Choiseul, but the King showed no interest in a new mistress, and in February 1765 he closed down the Parc-aux-Cerfs, where he had previously met his petites maitresses.

The resistance of the Parlements to the King's authority continued. The Parlements of the provinces began to quarrel with the Parlement of Paris over which more truly represented the nation.  In March 1764, the Parlement of Navarre in Pau, the smallest province, refused to accept the taxation authority of the Grand Council of the King. This time the King took action, arresting and replacing the President and leading officers of the Parlement, and replacing them with officers loyal to the King. The Parlements of Toulouse, Besançon and Rouen protested, but the King persisted.  In 1765 the Parlement of Brittany in Rennes denied the authority of the King's officers to impose taxes without its permission, and went on strike. The King summoned the Parlement to Versailles, where he had his lecture read to them.  This had little effect; when the King had his decree to the Parlement posted on the walls of Rennes, the Parlement ordered that the posters with the King's proclamation be taken down.  The King issued letters of cachet that forbade the Parlement members to leave Rennes, but the judicial system remained on strike.

The end of 1765 brought another personal tragedy; his son and heir Louis contracted tuberculosis.  He travelled with the King to the Palace of Fontainebleau.  The King distracted himself by secluding himself with the astronomer César-François Cassini de Thury and making astronomic calculations, while the doctors tried, without success, to treat his son.  The Dauphin died on 20 December 1765.  The succession was assured, since the Dauphin had a son, the future Louis XVI, who was of age to rule, but the death put him into a deep depression. He drafted his own will, writing: "If I made errors, it was not from a lack of will, but from a lack of talents, and for not having been supported as I wished to have been, particularly in matters of religion."

The Queen was deeply affected by the death of the Dauphin in 1765, then the death of her father in 1766, and then her daughter-in-law. She died on 24 June 1768.

# Mustafa III

Mustafa died of heart attack on 24 December 1773, at the Topkapı Palace, and was buried in his own mausoleum located at Laleli Mosque, Istanbul. He was succeeded by his brother Abdul Hamid I. His death left the empire struggling with economic and administrative problems.

# Johann Georg Schröpfer

According to several witnesses Schrepfer had a cheerful dinner with friends on the evening October 7, 1774 that lasted until 1:00 AM and involved lots of punch. Schrepfer and five of his associates - including lawyer Hoffmann and Karl von Sachsen's chamberlains Hans Rudolph von Bischoffswerder and Christian Friedrich von Hopfgarten - agreed to have a stroll to the Rosenthal forest on the edge of town at 5:00 in the morning, when it was still very dark. After he woke at 4:00 Schrepfer wrote several farewell letters of which a few transcripts are kept at the Leipzig city archives. The letter to DuBosc says (translated from German): "My beloved friend. You and W. have made it happen that I'm now in the other life! The ones that I call shall follow me, hear my friend I will pray to God for you: but I advice you by your life, don't leave Bisschofswerter and help him. Before the coming new year's fair a strange hand will pay for me. May God make your ending as peaceful as mine! God will be the judge between us. I'm your friend until death. Two hours before my death. JGSchrepffer." He reportedly bid farewell to his youngest child in the sweetest way and put his purse and gold watch in his wife's skirt. Schrepfer gave his companions the sealed farewell letters and asked them not read these before they would have returned to the city.

One of the witnesses did declare that Schrepfer had wanted to tell them something on the way. According to legend Schrepfer promised them an event like nothing they had ever seen before and probably would never witness ever again. Schrepfer disappeared from their sight for a moment, the sound of a gunshot was heard and Schröpfer was found dead. Some of the witnesses claimed he had magically disappeared or that only a necromantic ritual would be needed to resurrect him. Within half an hour after his death Schrepfer's body was brought to the nearby hospital where an autopsy was conducted. His remains were buried in silence on the hospital's burial ground for suicides on the same day.

The apparent suicide has later often been described as the result of Schrepfer's supposed delusions about his necromantic abilities, possibly partly due to the drugs he may have vaporized at his séances and which he must have repeatedly inhaled himself. He would have been perpetually tormented by evil spirits rendering his life miserable, or either he would have been convinced that he could resurrect himself after shooting himself to death. 

There are several serious indications that Schrepfer was actually murdered or persuaded and helped to commit suicide. Important evidence for murder was found in the fact that the bullet went through the front of Schrepfer's mouth, as if the weapon was forced between his lips by another person and the victim resisted by pressing his jaws together. There were also some inexplicable conflicting aspects in the statements of the witnesses and there were many possible motives to why he would have been killed. It seems like the affair was covered up. Wurmb wrote a letter to Elector Friedrich August III, nephew of Karl von Sachsen, stating that juridical investigation was impossible without implicating the prince. No further investigation took place.

# Adam Sherrill

Adam died May 4, 1774, of old age. He was 76 or 77. He left his wife and nine children. His sons Samuel and William later fought in the Revolutionary War at The Battle of King's Mountain, along with several of their sons.

# Mansur Shihab

Mansur later acted as a mediator between Yusuf and Zahir, who were ostensible enemies, when Yusuf needed Zahir's ally, the Russian Navy, to back him against Jezzar Pasha, the Ottoman general who ousted Yusuf from Beirut. Mansur died in 1774.

# Suklamphaa

Debera could visualize the consequences of the king's eventual recovery from his present physical prostration. Debera directed Saona Tamuli to ask Kharmaju Bez, a physician attending the sick monarch, to mix poison with the medicine to be administered to the patient. With no alternative left, Kharmaju was forced to obey the wish of Debera Borbarua, and the next dose of medicine brought the mortal years of Swargadeo Ramdhwaj Singha to an end. The event took place in November 1674, three days after the second massacre of the officials of Garhgaon. Ramdhwaj Singha's Chief Queen,the one who always advised the monarch against Debera Borbarua, daughter of Chapara khowa Gohain was buried alive with her deceased husband.

# Percy Wyndham-O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond

When Percy died unmarried and without issue in 1774 the earldom again became extinct. His estates passed to his nephew George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont (1751-1837) of Petworth House, Sussex and Orchard Wyndham.

# Zeynep Sultan

Zeynep Sultan died on 25 March 1774 and was buried in her own mosque located at Eminönü.
