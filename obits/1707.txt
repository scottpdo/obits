# Aurangzeb

By 1689, the conquest of Golconda, Mughal victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres, with a population estimated to be over 158 million. But this supremacy was short-lived. Jos Gommans, Professor of Colonial and Global History at the University of Leiden, says that "... the highpoint of imperial centralisation under emperor Aurangzeb coincided with the start of the imperial downfall."

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury to be held in trust for the citizens of his empire. He made caps and copied the Quran to earn money for his use. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) in the Red Fort complex in Delhi. However, his constant warfare, especially with the Marathas, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy just as much as the wasteful personal spending and opulence of his predecessors.

The Indologist Stanley Wolpert, emeritus professor at UCLA, says that:

Even when ill and dying, Aurangzeb made sure that the populace knew he was still alive, for if they had thought otherwise then the turmoil of another war of succession was likely. He died at his military camp in Bhingar near Ahmednagar on 20 February 1707 at the age of 89, having outlived many of his children. He had only 300 rupees with him which were later given to charity as per his instructions and he prior to his death requested not to spend extravagantly on his funeral but to keep it simple.
 His modest open-air grave in Khuldabad expresses his deep devotion to his Islamic beliefs. It is sited in the courtyard of the shrine of the Sufi saint Shaikh Burhan-u'd-din Gharib, who was a disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi.

Many Indian historians consider his death year 1707 as the one which marks the end of Medieval Indian history and the start of Modern Indian history when classifying Indian history. This is because of the start of decline of the Mughal empire and the start of domination of European powers in India.

Brown writes that after his death, "a string of weak emperors, wars of succession, and coups by noblemen heralded the irrevocable weakening of Mughal power". She notes that the populist but "fairly old-fashioned" explanation for the decline is that there was a reaction to Aurangzeb's oppression. Aurangzeb's son, Bahadur Shah I, succeeded him and the empire, both because of Aurangzeb's over-extension and because of Bahadur Shah's weak military and leadership qualities, entered a period of terminal decline. Immediately after Bahadur Shah occupied the throne, the Maratha Empire – which Aurangzeb had held at bay, inflicting high human and monetary costs even on his own empire – consolidated and launched effective invasions of Mughal territory, seizing power from the weak emperor. Within decades of Aurangzeb's death, the Mughal Emperor had little power beyond the walls of Delhi.

Aurangzeb's religious zeal exacted a heavy price both to himself and his nation. Will Durant states:

# Bidar Bakht

On the 3rd of March 1707 emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir passed away at his military camp in Ahmadnagar. Prince Bidar Bakht was informed about the death of the emperor by his father Azam Shah who was proclaimed as the new Mughal emperor. On hearing the news of his grandfathers demise Bidar Bakht was overwhelmed with grief. It was reported that the death of the late emperor dwelt long upon the mind of the prince who would frequently weep recollecting the late emperor whom he dearly loved.

# Sir William Davie, 4th Baronet

He died without male progeny and was buried on 24 March 1707 at Sandford. His heir to the baronetcy and to the Davie estates was his first cousin Sir John Davie, 5th Baronet (died 1727), son of Humphry Davie (born 1625), a merchant in the City of London (a younger son of the 1st Baronet), by his wife Mary White.

# Humphrey Edwin

Edwin died on 14 December 1707 at his seat in Llanmihangel, where a monument to his memory was set up in the parish church. His widow died in London on 22 November 1714, and was subsequently buried beside him at Llanmihangel.

# George Horner (died 1707)

Horner died at the age of  60 and was buried at Mells.

# Karolina of Legnica-Brieg

On 21 November 1675, Karolina's brother George William, the last Piast ruler of Legnica-Brzeg, died underage and without male heirs. The Princess explored the possibility of succeeding him in his domains. However, the Emperor Leopold I, despite the fact that he was a Catholic, objected to her plans. Only by an Imperial decree, dated 14 September 1680, did she receive an annual salary of 6,000 talers during her lifetime (later, the sum was reduced to 4,000 talers). Karolina settled her residence in Wrocław, the old city of her ancestors. She lived there alone, leading a devout life and giving to charitable activities.

# Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, Marquise de Montespan

The last years of Madame de Montespan's life were given up to a very severe penance.  Real sorrow over her death was felt by her three youngest children. She died on 27 May 1707 at the age of almost sixty-seven while taking the waters at Bourbon-l'Archambault in order to try to heal an illness. The king forbade her children to wear mourning for her.

# Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin

While there are no *Legitimate Sources or *Documentation to Prove that the Baron died in France; there is a Mountain of Evidence to suggest otherwise. 

According to Tradition; it is Claimed that the Baron left France in Early 1707 to return to his Family; who were under Threat from multiple Fronts. As a Loving & Devoted Father; he returned to his Children in their time of Distress.

It is said that he proclaimed: "I will not Raise Arms against my Brothers" as his reason for Leaving his Legal Battle France￼. Presumably his Siblings were threatening to use Force and Murder; which was Appalling to his sensibilities.

Many of his Children met him in Port Royal to welcome him Home. Among them was a Daughter named Marie Theresa; commonly known as "Princess Theresa". She is the Mother of "Chief Joseph Orono"; who famously told General Washington "I will not Raise Arms against my Brothers" and instead "I will pursue Peace through the Calumet". An echo of the Words of the Baron.

According to Tradition; the Baron and his Daughter Marie Theresa were in Port Royal at the time of the 1707 Attack; and were killed there.

Other Oral Tradition says that he died in France. Other than certain *Dictionaries repeating this oft quoted ￼Oral Tradition; there is no *Evidence or *Proof or even a *Grave to support this Assertion.

However; there has arisen *Evidence and *Proof of the Tradition which maintains that he died in Port Royal in 1707, alongside his Daughter, Marie Theresa:

In 1899–1900 Frank Hamilton Cushing, a famous anthropologist from the Smithsonian, while conducting a dig on Campbell Island, just off Deer Island Maine, uncovered a French skeleton in armor. The weapons and items were identical to those of a French officer of the Carignan-Salières regiment. A halberd, sword, blunderbuss and other weapons were recovered. A tomahawk was found with a Maltese cross etched on it. The remains were found buried next to a Native American woman. They were repatriated to the Penobscot Nation; because it is Claimed and Accepted that these are the remains of the Baron and his Daughter. 

Supporting this Agreement; is the fact that the Symbol on the Tomahawk is the Royal Seal of Madockawando; as well as there being no other Personage that it could possibly be. No alternative Personage is Offered.

# Anthony Sharp (Quaker)

Anthony Sharp died on 13 January 1707, and was buried in the ancient Friends' burying-ground adjacent to St. Stephen's Green in the city of Dublin. He was survived by three sons, Isaac, Joseph and Daniel, and one daughter, Rachel Sharp. Anthony Sharp's father (born about 1603 in Tetbury, Gloucester, England) married Anthony's mother, Elizabeth Hookham on 27 Nov 1628 in Gloucester. Elizabeth Hookham was born about 1607 in Gloucester. They had 7 children William, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Anthony, Isaac, Anis, and Thomas.

# Cloudesley Shovell

While returning with the fleet to England after the campaign at Toulon, Shovell's flagship, the second-rate HMS Association, struck the rocks near the Isles of Scilly at 8 pm on 22 October (2 November, by the modern calendar) 1707. HMS Association went down in three or four minutes, with none of the 800 men that were on board saved, according to sailors watching on the first-rate HMS St George. Four large ships, HMS Association, the third-rate HMS Eagle, the fourth-rate HMS Romney and the fire ship HMS Firebrand all sank.

With nearly 2,000 sailors lost that night, the Scilly naval disaster was recorded as one of the greatest maritime disasters in British history. The cause of the disaster has often been represented as the navigators' inability accurately to calculate their longitude, although no public discussion of the events specifically raising the question of longitude is known, prior to a pamphlet published on the eve of Parliament's vote on the Longitude Act, seven years later.

Shovell's body and those of both his stepsons were all found in Porthellick Cove on St Mary's, almost 7 miles (11 km) from where his ship was wrecked. It was possible that Shovell left his flagship in one of its boats along with his two stepsons and the captain of HMS Association, Edmund Loades, and that they were drowned while trying to get to shore.

Shovell's body was identified by the purser of the third-rate HMS Arundel who knew the admiral well. It was identified by "a black mole under his left ear, also by the first joint of one of his forefingers being broken inwards. He had likewise a shot in his right arm, another in his left thigh". Shovell was temporarily buried on the beach at Porthellick Cove. By order of Queen Anne the body was later exhumed and brought back in the fourth-rate HMS Salisbury to Plymouth, where it was embalmed by Dr James Yonge. It was later carried in state to London. During the journey from the West Country, large crowds turned out to pay their respects. He was interred in Westminster Abbey on 22 December 1707: his large marble monument in the south choir aisle was sculpted by Grinling Gibbons. Meanwhile, his two stepsons were buried in Old Town Church on St Mary's.

Local legend has it that Shovell was alive, at least barely, when he reached the shore of Scilly at Porthellick Cove but was murdered by a woman for the sake of his priceless emerald ring, which had been given to him by a close friend, Captain James Lord Dursley. At that time, the Scillies had a wild and lawless reputation. It is claimed that the murder came to light only some thirty years later when the woman, on her deathbed, confessed to a clergyman to having killed the admiral and produced the stolen ring, which was sent back to Dursley. Several historians doubt the murder story as there is no indication that the ring was recovered and the legend stems from a romantic and unverifiable deathbed confession.

Another legend alleges that a common sailor on the flagship tried to warn Shovell that the fleet was off course but Shovell had him hanged at the yardarm for inciting mutiny. The story first appeared in the Scilly Isles in 1780, with the common sailor being a Scilly native, who recognized the waters as being close to home but was punished for warning the admiral. While it is possible that a sailor may have debated the vessel's location and feared for its fate (such debates were common upon entering the English Channel, as noted by Samuel Pepys in 1684), the story has been repeatedly discredited by naval scholars, who noted the lack of any evidence in contemporary documents, its fanciful stock conventions and dubious origins. After his death Shovell became a popular British hero.

# Alice Thornton

Thornton died in 1707 in East Newton and left three books to her daughter, Mrs. Alice Comber, who died in 1727.

In 1875 the Surtees Society published the first version of her biography. This version was expurgated. Since that time the middle of Thornton's books has been lost but the other two have been made available by the collector who owns them. In 2019, the missing book was found in the archives of Durham cathedral.
