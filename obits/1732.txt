# Francis Atterbury

Atterbury survived the shock of his daughter's death, and returned to Paris and to the service of the Pretender. In the ninth year of his banishment he published a vindication of himself against John Oldmixon, who had accused him of having, in concert with other Christ Church men, garbled the new edition of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion. He was not one of the editors of the History, and had never seen it until it was printed. Atterbury died, aged 68, on 22 February 1732.
His body was brought to England, and interred in Westminster Abbey. 
In his papers now kept at the Library of Westminster, he desired to be buried "as far from kings and politicians as may be." Thus he is buried next to a 21st-century tourist information booth kiosk. The black slab is simple, indicating his name, birth and death dates; the inscription is now considerably worn.

Of his wife, Katherine Osborn, whom he married while at Oxford, little is known; but between him and his daughter there was affection. His fondness for John Milton was such as to many Tories seemed a crime; and he was the close friend of Joseph Addison. He lived on friendly terms with Jonathan Swift, John Arbuthnot and John Gay. With Matthew Prior he had a close intimacy. Alexander Pope found in Atterbury an admirer, adviser, and editor as requested.

# John Ayliffe

He died 5 November 1732.

# Simon Browne

# Benedict Leonard Calvert

Calvert had tuberculosis and died of consumption on board the family ship, The Charles on 1 June 1732, while returning to his home in England. He was buried at sea. He left an estate worth around ten thousand pounds sterling, a large sum at the time, to his younger brother Cecilius Calvert.

# George Camocke

Once back in Spain, he was banished to Ceuta and he died either there or in Rouen a few years later.

# Francis Charteris (rake)

In 1732, he died from natural causes in Edinburgh, possibly from a condition caused by his stay in Newgate Prison. Shortly before he died, he was said to have stated that he would pay £150,000 to anybody who could prove to him that there was no hell. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard; his coffin was attacked on its way to the graveyard, and it is said that dead cats were thrown into his grave.  Upon his death, John Arbuthnot published "Epitaph on Don Francisco" in The London Magazine (April 1732).  In it, he wrote that Charteris was a man,

# Marie Émilie de Joly de Choin

After Louis's death in 1711, she withdrew into retirement. Louis left her a fortune in his will, but she tore up the will with the words that when he was alive she needed only him and after his death only a pittance. Marie Emilie was given a pension by the king and devoted herself to charity, not participating in society life. She died in Paris, "universally respected for her private virtues".

# Étienne Doirat

He died in 1732.

# George Duckett (Calne MP)

Duckett  died at home on his Calne estate in 1732.  He had  married Grace Skinner (c. 1690-1755) on 23 March 1711. The couple had nine children, eight of whom survived to adult life.

# William Egerton (1684–1732)

Egerton died on 15 July 1732. He had married Anna Maria Saunders, the daughter of Admiral Sir George Saunders, Commissioner of the Navy, and had three daughters. His daughter Jane married Thomas Revell MP of Fetcham Park.

# Isaac Fawkes

While Fawkes was performing at one of the fairs early in 1732 a fire broke out in a neighbouring booth and frightened his wife, Alice, so severely that she had to go into an "early confinement". Whether this fire was connected to Fawkes' death later that year is not known. Fawkes died on 25 May 1732 and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster three days later. He had amassed a considerable fortune to leave to Alice; reports at the time suggested he "had honestly acquired a fortune of above ten thousand pounds, being no more than he really deserved for his great ingenuity, by which he surpassed all that ever pretended to be art."

Pinchbeck's younger son, Edward, took over the business alongside Fawkes' son. On 17 November, Edward married Fawkes' widow, Alice, at most a few days before his father died (reports vary between 18 and 22 November). Fawkes' show appears to have initially continued to flourish under the management of his son and Pinchbeck – in 1733 they exhibited clocks and automata again as the "Grand Theatre of the Muses" at Bartholomew Fair – but they slowly moved towards producing shows of puppetry and working as puppeteers and, although they were still advertising their booth at Southwark Fair in 1741, they seem to have ceased performing after 1746.

Aside from his possible appearance in Southwark Fair there are few images of Fawkes; there is a broadsheet by Sutton Nichols which includes a panel featuring Fawkes and this basic line sketch is used again in one of his extant advertisements, but the best-known portrait is a detail from a Bartholomew Fair souvenir fan – possibly painted by Thomas Loggon in around 1740 – which features an image of Fawkes on the promotional show-cloth of his stand.

# James Gardiner the Younger

He died at Lincoln, 24 March 1731-2, and was buried in the retrochoir of the cathedral, by the side of his father. His only daughter, Susanna, who had nursed him assiduously, followed him to the grave in little more than a month, 27 April, and was buried in the same grave in which his wife, Dinah, was also buried, 4 September 1734. His monument bears a very lengthy epitaph, which describes him as a man of great suavity of disposition and beneficence, a cultured and popular preacher, and of some success as an author.

# John Horsley (antiquarian)

Horsley died of apoplexy on 12 January 1732, on the eve of the publication of the Britannia Romana.

# Mihrişah Kadın

She died in 1732, and was buried in the mausoleum of imperial ladies, New Mosque, Istanbul. Şehzade Mustafa ascended the throne as Mustafa III after Sultan Osman III's death in 1757. However, she was never Valide Sultan, as she had died before Mustafa ascended the throne. He commissioned the Ayazma Mosque in memory of his mother, and elder half brother Şehzade Süleyman. A fountain is also present near her tomb.

# Herman Moll

Moll died on 22 September 1732, as noted in his obituary in Gentleman's Magazine.

# Francis Negus

Negus died at  Dallinghoo,  on 9 September 1732 leaving a son and daughter. The Ipswich Gazette published a poem in his memory which began 'Is Negus gone? ah! Ipswich weep and mourn'.

# Şermi Kadın

She died in 1732, and was buried in the mausoleum of imperial ladies, in the New Mosque in Istanbul. Abdul Hamid ascended the throne in 1774 after the death of his elder half brother Mustafa III. However, she was never Valide Sultan, as she had died forty two years before Abdul Hamid ascended the throne. He created the Beylerbeyi Mosque in memory of his mother.

# Woodes Rogers

With both the government and his former partners refusing to honour his debts, Rogers was released from debtor's prison only when his creditors took pity on him and absolved him of his debts. Even so, Rogers wrote that he was "perplexed with the melancholy prospect of [his] affairs".  In 1722 or 1723, Rogers was approached by a man writing a history of piracy, and supplied him with information. The resulting work, A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, published under the pseudonym Captain Charles Johnson, was an enormous hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and catapulted Rogers for the second time to the status of a national hero. With public attention focused on him again, Rogers was successful in 1726 in petitioning the king for financial redress. Not only did King George I grant him a pension, retroactive to 1721, but the king's son and successor, George II, reappointed him as governor on 22 October 1728.

The Bahamas did not come under external threat during Rogers' second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking to bolster the island's defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers' absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went to Charleston in early 1731 in an attempt to recover his health. Though he returned in July 1731, he never truly regained his health, and died in Nassau on 15 July 1732.

A harbour-side street in Nassau is named for Rogers.  "Piracy expelled, commerce restored" remained the motto of the Bahamas until the islands gained independence in 1973.

# Frances Mackenzie, Countess of Seaforth

After her husband's death, she remained in Paris, and died there on 18 December, 1732, aged 73.

# Dionisia de Santa María Mitas Talangpaz

Dionisia died in 1732, a year after her sister Cecilia.

# Ümmügülsüm Sultan

The Patrona Halil rebellion against her father ended whatever good days Ümmügülsüm may have had, and in November 1732, at the age of twenty four, she died. She is buried in the New Mosque, Istanbul.

# Thomas White (1667–1732)

White died suddenly of an apoplectic fit at Wallingwells on 30 September 1732 aged 63 years. He is buried under the High Altar in Tuxford Church. His widow Bridget continued to live at Wallingwells until her death on 17 January 1761. White and his wife Bridget had five children:

White was described by his third cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu as a jovial countryman. George Gregory said of him that he had ‘lost a good friend and the public a good officer’ and thecountry a ‘useful person among us’.
