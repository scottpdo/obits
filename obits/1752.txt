# Devasahayam Pillai

In 1752, the original order of the King and his Dewan was to deport him from Travancore, into the Pandya country, at Aralvaimozhy. He was let off in the forested hills near Aralvaimozhy. There, he is believed to have begun deep meditations, and the people from the adjacent villages began visiting the holy man. Christian sources allege that at this time, high caste Hindus plotted to do away with Devasahayam.:134

Some people believe that the soldiers went up the forested hills and tried to shoot Devasahayam, but were unable to fire; after which he took the gun in his hands, blessed it and gave it back to the soldiers to shoot him to death, if they wished to. The soldiers took the gun back and fired at him five times. His body was then carelessly thrown out near the foothills at Kattadimalai.:285:83

It was at Kattadimali in Kanyakumari district that Devasahayam Pillai died on 14 January 1752. His mortal remains were interred near the altar inside St. Xavier's Church, Kottar, Nagercoil, which is now the diocesan Cathedral.:285

Since the days of the interment of the mortal remains of Devesahayam Pillai many Christian pilgrims visited his tomb and offered prayers.[citation needed]

# James Gibson (seaman)

In the fall of 1752 Gibson was losing substantial income from the mismanagement of his Jamaica plantation, and so he left Boston and sailed to Jamaica to confront the overseer.  On the day that he was scheduled to depart, his overseer invited him to dinner and "promised a satisfactory adjustment".  After dinner he set sail for Boston but after three hours died in great agony, and the crew suspected that he had been poisoned.  His widow Thomazine died in Boston weeks after having been informed of his death, on 13 November 1752, leaving their fifteen-year-old daughter Mary and orphan.

# Henriette of France (1727–1752)

Henriette died of smallpox in 1752 at the age of twenty-four. In February of that year, she had felt somewhat unwell and tired, but when the king asked her to accompany him on a sledge ride, she gave no signs of her discomfort, and accepted the invitation anyway. She was badly affected by the chilly weather, and died after just three days of illness. Her family was described as being in a "state of stupefaction over the rapidity of the illness."

Louis XV reacted with "violent" despair upon her death and gave order of the highest honors around her funeral; in order the enhance the public mourning, her remains were placed at the Tuileries instead of Versailles prior to the funeral, dressed in one of her finest dresses and made up so to appear alive.   The public funeral reception was however not to the king's taste, as the public "drank, laughed and amused themselves", which was taken as a sign of the diminishing reputation of the monarchy. At the time, the public interpreted the death of Henriette as a sign of divine disapproval of the king's lifestyle.

Her heart was interred in the Abbey of Val-de-Grace, while her remains were buried at the Basilica of Saint Denis, along with her sister Elisabeth. Her tomb, like other royal tombs at Saint-Denis, was destroyed during the French Revolution.

Madame Campan later wrote about her: "Madame Henriette, twin sister of the Duchess of Parma, was much regretted, for she had considerable influence over the King’s mind, and it was remarked that if she had lived she would have been assiduous in finding him amusements in the bosom of his family, would have followed him in his short excursions, and would have done the honours of the ‘petits soupers’ which he was so fond of giving in his private apartments."

# Samuel Ogle

# Arthur Price (bishop)

In May 1744, Dr Price succeeded Theophilus Bolton as archbishop of Cashel. He over-ruled plans already in train to restore the old cathedral, claiming that it was incapable of being re-roofed despite advice to the contrary. Using political contacts in the Irish Privy Council on 10 July 1749 he got permission to build a new cathedral. In 1783, a new cathedral building was completed on the site of St John's. In the meantime, what remained of the Rock of Cashel after Price had ordered its gutting and de-roofing, has become a primary tourist destination. Price's decision to remove the roof on what had been the jewel among Irish church buildings was criticised before and since.

In 1747, he was made vice-chancellor of Trinity College Dublin.[citation needed]

Price died in 1752 and was buried beneath the aisle of St Mary's church, Leixlip, County Kildare.

# Chanda Sahib

At Arcot, and later at Kaveripakkam (Coillady), Chanda Sahib's son was defeated and later killed by the British.

Following this Chanda Sahib escaped to what was probably his hometown at Tanjore, only to be captured by the "Maratha army of Tanjore". He was beheaded by a Tanjore Raja named Pratap Singh of Thanjavur.

The English quickly installed Muhammed Ali as the Nawab of Arcot and most of Chanda Sahib's native forces defected to the English.

# John Scrope (MP)

As Scrope died without issue, his estate of Wormsley passed to the descendants of his sister Anne (died 1720), who had married Henry Fane.

Fane also succeeded a distant cousin and became 8th Earl of Westmorland in 1762.

He was buried in the south chancel of St Michael's Church, East Peckham, under a plain stone with no inscription.

# Robert White (Virginia physician)

White died in 1752 at the age of 64 and was interred in the eastern corner of the Old Opequon Cemetery at the Opequon Presbyterian Church in Kernstown, 3 miles (4.8 km) south of Winchester. By 1855, a tree was located at White's burial site in the eastern corner of the cemetery, and the same tree remained at his burial site in 1891. White was survived by his three sons, Robert, Alexander, and John, and his wife. His son, Dr. Robert White, Jr., inherited the White family farm following White's death.

# Isaac Whood

# Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf

Zinzendorf died in a house in Dean's Yard of Westminster Abbey, London, on May 28, 1752, from a hemorrhage due to tuberculosis, with John Nitschmann, his former tutor, beside him. He was buried on the grounds of Lindsey House, "Sharon," the Moravian Graveyard located in Chelsea outside London, where his father lived at that time while directing the worldwide missionary effort of the church.

When the Moravian Brethren and Sisters refused to forswear their allegiance to the elder Zinzendorf and sever their connection to the Moravian Church in the 1750s at the insistence of Gustav Friedrich, Count of Isenburg-Büdingen, Herrnhaag was closed and a great number of Moravians came to Bethlehem and Nazareth in Pennsylvania. A farming community had already been established near Nazareth for the Single Brethren named Christiansbrunn, Christian's Spring. One of the brothers wrote a poem stating that Christel lived again in the Congregation at the spring and that the flowing waters restored him “more and more.”
