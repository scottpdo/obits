# Devasahayam Pillai

In 1752, the original order of the King and his Dewan was to deport him from Travancore, into the Pandya country, at Aralvaimozhy. He was let off in the forested hills near Aralvaimozhy. There, he is believed to have begun deep meditations, and the people from the adjacent villages began visiting the holy man. Christian sources allege that at this time, high caste Hindus plotted to do away with Devasahayam.:134

Some people believe that the soldiers went up the forested hills and tried to shoot Devasahayam, but were unable to fire; after which he took the gun in his hands, blessed it and gave it back to the soldiers to shoot him to death, if they wished to. The soldiers took the gun back and fired at him five times. His body was then carelessly thrown out near the foothills at Kattadimalai.:285:83

It was at Kattadimali in Kanyakumari district that Devasahayam Pillai died on 14 January 1752. His mortal remains were interred near the altar inside St. Xavier's Church, Kottar, Nagercoil, which is now the diocesan Cathedral.:285

Since the days of the interment of the mortal remains of Devesahayam Pillai many Christian pilgrims visited his tomb and offered prayers.[citation needed]

# James Gibson (seaman)

In the fall of 1752 Gibson was losing substantial income from the mismanagement of his Jamaica plantation, and so he left Boston and sailed to Jamaica to confront the overseer.  On the day that he was scheduled to depart, his overseer invited him to dinner and "promised a satisfactory adjustment".  After dinner he set sail for Boston but after three hours died in great agony, and the crew suspected that he had been poisoned.  His widow Thomazine died in Boston weeks after having been informed of his death, on 13 November 1752, leaving their fifteen-year-old daughter Mary and orphan.
