# Giacomo Abbondo

He died in 1788 with a deep reputation for holiness and well known across the area for the pious life that he led. Pilgrimages to his tomb became common and there were immediate calls for his beatification to commence. His remains were later transferred on 13 March 1922. An elementary school was named in his honor in 1994.

# Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel

  Augusta Grave in Kullamaa Church.


After Augusta's father had refused to countenance a divorce, and with Augusta showing clear signs of proving her husband right in the matter of behavior with men of lower rank, Catherine found it necessary to make arrangements for her removal from the palace. She gave Augusta the use of one of her Imperial estates, Lohde castle, in Lohde (now Koluvere) in Kullamaa Parish to the south-west of Tallinn, Estonia. Augusta was put in the custody of Wilhelm von Pohlmann (9 April 1727 – 22 January 1796), a former hunt-master. Augusta quickly began a sexual relationship with her custodian, and soon became pregnant by him.

On 27 September 1788, aged 23, Augusta went into premature labour with a stillborn child, followed by hemorrhaging. Pohlmann refused to send for a doctor or any other medical help, fearful that his illegitimate relationship to her would be exposed. Augusta died of blood loss. She was hurriedly buried in an unmarked grave in the church at Koluvere. Brief letters were then written to the Empress Catherine and to Augusta's father in Brunswick, blandly announcing her death and giving the cause as the breaking of a blood vessel. Sightings of Augusta (or her ghost) were reported for several years in the vicinity of Lohde castle, which suggests some local belief of scandal, tragedy or foul play, but no sighting proved to be true. The facts of her death only came to light many years later, when her eldest son had the matter investigated and her body was exhumed. Augusta's story was fictionalized by Thackeray in The Luck of Barry Lyndon.

She is buried in Kullamaa church. On her tombstone is the text: "Hic jacet in pace Augusta Carolina Friderica Luisa Ducis Brunsuicencis-Guelferbytani Filia Friderici Guilielmi Caroli Ducis Vurtembergensis et Supremi Praefecti Viburgiensis Uxor Nat. d. III. Dec. MDCCLXIV Denat. d. XIV. Sept. MDCCLXXXVIII"

The castle and lands of Koluvere were afterwards granted to Count Frederik Vilhelm Buxhoevden.

# Ruth Bowyer

Bowyer was returned to Newgate Prison where she remained for the next six months. On 30 April 1787 she and 36 other women were brought to Portsmouth and embarked aboard the convict transport Prince of Wales. Ten other female convicts were also brought from prison hulks on the Thames, bringing to 47 the total number of convicts aboard the ship.

Prince of Wales sailed from Portsmouth on 13 May 1787 as part of the First Fleet to Australia. Due to an administrative oversight, no female clothing had been brought aboard and Bowyer and her fellow convicts remained in their increasingly ragged prison apparel until 6 August, when the ship reached Rio de Janeiro and was resupplied. Near Rio, humid conditions and heavy rains generated a "plague of bugs" below decks with more than a hundred insects found in one small sleeping area alone. There were also reports of rats, fleas and lice, and an outbreak of scurvy in late December.

The Fleet reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, and relocated to Sydney Cove eight days later. On disembarkation around 200 of the male convicts from the Fleet were set to work clearing the foreshore and constructing huts. Female convicts including Bowyer were left to their own devices, subsisting on a limited ration of salted meat, rancid butter and shellfish. Conditions were harsh and Bowyer was one of 94 convicts who fell seriously ill within the first six months of arrival. She died on 5 June 1788, less than two years into her sentence, and was buried along the shoreline of the Cove.

# John Brown (doctor)

In 1786 Brown went to London to improve his fortunes but died of apoplexy two years later, on 17 October 1788.

In 1789 a Cambridge undergraduate called William Margaretson Heald published The Brunoniad, a mock epic poem about Brown, mocking his consumption of alcohol and opium and referring to a bar brawl in Dunn's Hotel in Edinburgh's New Town.

# Charles Allan Cathcart

  The tombstone of Colonel Charles Cathcart, ambassador to China, who died on his ship and was buried at a Dutch outpost in the Sunda Strait.


When Cathcart died at sea aboard the ship Vestal on 10 June 1788 in the Straits of Bangka off Sumatra, the ship returned to Anjer-Lor, West Java, Indonesia, to avoid burial in shark-infested waters. He was interred in the morning of 16 June "to a salute of minute guns fired from the V'estal and of volleys of small arms." Before his companions returned to England, they built him a monument comprising a painted panel with Latin inscriptions, which was designed by Julius Caesar Ibbetson. The monument was built to commemorate Cathcart as "ordered by the Honorable Thomas Stamfort Raffles Lieutenant Governor of Java." The following year, Ibbotson displayed his painting of the burial scene at the Royal Academy. A rendition the monument was also completed by Jacobus Flikkenschild in 1815.
