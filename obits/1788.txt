# Giacomo Abbondo

He died in 1788 with a deep reputation for holiness and well known across the area for the pious life that he led. Pilgrimages to his tomb became common and there were immediate calls for his beatification to commence. His remains were later transferred on 13 March 1922. An elementary school was named in his honor in 1994.

# Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel

After Augusta's father had refused to countenance a divorce, and with Augusta showing clear signs of proving her husband right in the matter of behavior with men of lower rank, Catherine found it necessary to make arrangements for her removal from the palace. She gave Augusta the use of one of her Imperial estates, Lohde castle, in Lohde (now Koluvere) in Kullamaa Parish to the south-west of Tallinn, Estonia. Augusta was put in the custody of Wilhelm von Pohlmann (9 April 1727 – 22 January 1796), a former hunt-master. Augusta quickly began a sexual relationship with her custodian, and soon became pregnant by him.

On 27 September 1788, aged 23, Augusta went into premature labour with a stillborn child, followed by hemorrhaging. Pohlmann refused to send for a doctor or any other medical help, fearful that his illegitimate relationship to her would be exposed. Augusta died of blood loss. She was hurriedly buried in an unmarked grave in the church at Koluvere. Brief letters were then written to the Empress Catherine and to Augusta's father in Brunswick, blandly announcing her death and giving the cause as the breaking of a blood vessel. Sightings of Augusta (or her ghost) were reported for several years in the vicinity of Lohde castle, which suggests some local belief of scandal, tragedy or foul play, but no sighting proved to be true. The facts of her death only came to light many years later, when her eldest son had the matter investigated and her body was exhumed. Augusta's story was fictionalized by Thackeray in The Luck of Barry Lyndon.

She is buried in Kullamaa church. On her tombstone is the text: "Hic jacet in pace Augusta Carolina Friderica Luisa Ducis Brunsuicencis-Guelferbytani Filia Friderici Guilielmi Caroli Ducis Vurtembergensis et Supremi Praefecti Viburgiensis Uxor Nat. d. III. Dec. MDCCLXIV Denat. d. XIV. Sept. MDCCLXXXVIII"

The castle and lands of Koluvere were afterwards granted to Count Frederik Vilhelm Buxhoevden.

# Anthony Bledsoe

He was murdered by Indians on July 20, 1788 in Castalian Springs, Tennessee.

# John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon

Lord Boringdon died in April 1788.

# Ruth Bowyer

Bowyer was returned to Newgate Prison where she remained for the next six months. On 30 April 1787 she and 36 other women were brought to Portsmouth and embarked aboard the convict transport Prince of Wales. Ten other female convicts were also brought from prison hulks on the Thames, bringing to 47 the total number of convicts aboard the ship.

Prince of Wales sailed from Portsmouth on 13 May 1787 as part of the First Fleet to Australia. Due to an administrative oversight, no female clothing had been brought aboard and Bowyer and her fellow convicts remained in their increasingly ragged prison apparel until 6 August, when the ship reached Rio de Janeiro and was resupplied. Near Rio, humid conditions and heavy rains generated a "plague of bugs" below decks with more than a hundred insects found in one small sleeping area alone. There were also reports of rats, fleas and lice, and an outbreak of scurvy in late December.

The Fleet reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, and relocated to Sydney Cove eight days later. On disembarkation around 200 of the male convicts from the Fleet were set to work clearing the foreshore and constructing huts. Female convicts including Bowyer were left to their own devices, subsisting on a limited ration of salted meat, rancid butter and shellfish. Conditions were harsh and Bowyer was one of 94 convicts who fell seriously ill within the first six months of arrival. She died on 5 June 1788, less than two years into her sentence, and was buried along the shoreline of the Cove.

# John Brown (doctor)

In 1786 Brown went to London to improve his fortunes but died of apoplexy two years later, on 17 October 1788.

In 1789 a Cambridge undergraduate called William Margaretson Heald published The Brunoniad, a mock epic poem about Brown, mocking his consumption of alcohol and opium and referring to a bar brawl in Dunn's Hotel in Edinburgh's New Town.

# Benedict Swingate Calvert

Benedict Swingate Calvert died at Mount Airy on January 9, 1788. He was buried beneath the chancel of the church of St Thomas in Croom, Prince George's County, Maryland, a church which Calvert had helped to found and maintain.

Calvert's descendants continued to live at the Mount Airy plantation house until the early 20th century. In 1973, it was acquired by the State of Maryland and became Rosaryville State Park.

# Charles Allan Cathcart

When Cathcart died at sea aboard the ship Vestal on 10 June 1788 in the Straits of Bangka off Sumatra, the ship returned to Anjer-Lor, West Java, Indonesia, to avoid burial in shark-infested waters. He was interred in the morning of 16 June "to a salute of minute guns fired from the V'estal and of volleys of small arms." Before his companions returned to England, they built him a monument comprising a painted panel with Latin inscriptions, which was designed by Julius Caesar Ibbetson. The monument was built to commemorate Cathcart as "ordered by the Honorable Thomas Stamfort Raffles Lieutenant Governor of Java." The following year, Ibbotson displayed his painting of the burial scene at the Royal Academy. A rendition the monument was also completed by Jacobus Flikkenschild in 1815.

# Thomas Cushing

Thomas Cushing died in Boston on February 28, 1788, while serving as lieutenant governor.  He was buried in Boston's Granary Burying Ground.  Cushing, Maine is named in his honor.

# Charles-Augustin de Ferriol d'Argental

D'Argental died in 1788 after contracting a fever, which lasted only a few days.

# James Freney

It is not known where or how long he was abroad, if at all, but by 1776 he had settled at the port of New Ross and worked as a customs official, a post he held until his death in on 20 December 1788. He was buried in Inistioge.

# William Houston

He died of tuberculosis the following year in Frankford, Pennsylvania (now part of Philadelphia) and was buried at the Second Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Philadelphia. Later, he was reburied at the Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia.

# José, Prince of Brazil

José died at the age of 27 of smallpox. Upon José's death, his younger brother Infante John became heir-apparent to the throne and thus the new Prince of Brazil. José died on the Ajuda Royal Complex in Lisbon. His mother and wife were very badly affected by his death. His wife would be known as the "Dowager Princess of Brazil" till her death in 1829.

José is buried in the Pantheon of the House of Braganza in Lisbon, the resting place for most of the members of the House of Braganza.

# John Lindsay (Royal Navy officer)

Sandwich and his successors appreciated Lindsay's ability, and he was appointed as Admiralty Commissioner between April and December 1783. He next was assigned as commodore and commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, with HMS Trusty as his flagship. At Naples June 24, 1784, he entertained the king and queen of Sicily on board his ship.

Soon afterward, his health began to fail and he had to return to England. He was promoted to "rear admiral of the red" on 24 September 1787. For health reasons he held it as an honorary role rather than an active one. He died at Marlborough, on his way from a health trip to Bath, on 4 June 1788, aged fifty-one. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.

# Old Tassel

Old Tassel and another pacifist chief, Abraham of Chilhowee, were murdered while under a flag of truce during an entreaty to the State of Franklin in June 1788. Wrongfully blamed for the murder of the Kirk family, then being lured to Abraham's cabin by the flag of truce, the "Bloody Seven" were tied to chairs and John Kirk was allowed by the US Government to tomahawk each man in the forehead. Old Tassel was boisterous in his death, stood up with the tomahawk in his forehead, pulled it out and advised "sir you have misjudged me, you must strike again" and bowed his head to the wrongful revenger. He was known as the Great Orator.
The act was considered an atrocity by the Cherokee, and briefly brought all the Cherokee to support the hostile actions of the warriors following Dragging Canoe.

# Jonathan Shipley

Jonathan Shipley married Anna Maria Mordaunt, daughter of Rev George Mordaunt and Elizabeth Doyley, and left descendants - his son, William Davies Shipley (1745–1826), became Dean of St Asaph.

# Abel Smith (1717–1788)

He died on 12 July 1788 at Wilford House, the family home in Nottinghamshire, aged seventy-one, and was buried in St. Peter's Church, Nottingham.

# Charles Edward Stuart

Charles died in Rome of a stroke on 31 January 1788, aged 67. He was first buried in the Frascati Cathedral, where his brother Henry Benedict Stuart was bishop. At Henry's death in 1807, Charles's remains (except his heart) were moved to the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican where they were laid to rest next to those of his brother and his father near the monument to the Royal Stuarts. His mother is also buried in St. Peter's Basilica. His heart remained in Frascati Cathedral, where it is contained in a small urn beneath the floor under a monument.

# Pierre André de Suffren

While refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-admiral of France (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a "gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess"[note 1]

A legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.

# Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane

After the publication of her memoirs, Lady Vane spent most of her time in Bath, Somerset. Her erratic lifestyle soon ruined her husband's finances. Struck by an illness, she was bedridden for the last 20 years of her life. During that time, she contemplated converting to Roman Catholicism. She died childless on 31 March 1788 at her home in Hill Street, Mayfair, London, and was buried in the Vane family vault in Shipborne, Kent. Lord Vane, who had remained faithful to her despite the social humiliation caused by her sexual adventures, died the next year.

# Noël Jourda de Vaux

In February 1769 the comte de Vaux was put in command of the French forces on Corsica. He landed on the island on 7 April and reached Saint-Florent on 22 June. General de Vaux wrote to the duc de Choiseul "The whole of Corsica is submitted to the King" and on 1 August was made governor general.

On 10 April 1779 he ceded his command to the comte de Marbeuf to be made commander in chief of the army meant for a landing in England with Spanish naval support. This army also included Rochambeau and Lafayette. However, the project was abandoned and in 1780 de Vaux was instead made commander in chief of the province of the county of Burgundy. On 13 June 1783 he was made marshal of France, with the motto "Terror belli, Decus pacis" inscribed on his marshal's baton.

At the end of June 1788, just after the Day of the Tiles, de Vaux replaced the duc de Clermont-Tonnerre as lieutenant général commanding the province of the Dauphiné, with orders to suppress the popular uprising. However, he had only just arrived in Grenoble when he fell ill, dying aged 83 on 14 September 1788. He had fought in thirty sieges and five major battles and been wounded five times. In his will he asked that his heart be buried at Paray, of which he was seigneur, and his body in the chapelle de Vaux in the church at Retournac, the land of his birth.

# Jean-Baptiste Veyren

He died on April 9, 1788.

# Charles Wesley
