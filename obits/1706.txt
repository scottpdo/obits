# James Bringfeild

He was killed during the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May 1706. There is a memorial tablet to his memory in the north aisle of the nave at Westminster Abbey. The account of the death was recorded by Captain Robert Parker of the Royal Regiment of Foot of Ireland, who wrote "His Grace (the Duke of Marlborough) had another narrow escape; when in shifting back from Captain Molesworth's horse to his own, Colonel Bringfield holding the stirrup, was killed by a cannon-shot from the village of Ramillies." The death is mentioned in the Duke's letter to his wife Sara. It is believed that the shot may have decapitated him and the manner of his death resulted in many poems and stories being compiled during the period.

# Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville

In 1702, England and France were again at war (War of the Spanish Succession, 1701–1714, the North American theater of which was Queen Anne's War).  D'Iberville had contracted malaria on the Gulf coast, and both his health and judgment seem to have deteriorated.  Early in 1706, he left France in command of twelve vessels.  From 1 to 22 April, he devastated the island of Nevis and took the entire population prisoner.  He went to Havana, where he was involved in planning an expedition against Charles Town, Carolina (an English colonial settlement), when he died suddenly, perhaps of yellow fever, in July, 1706. D'Iberville was buried at Church of San Cristóbal (Havana Cathedral);  the burial records identify him under his french name,  and as 
El General Dom Pedro Berbila.

After his death, his estate became involved in an inquiry that dragged on for more than thirty years.  D'Iberville had acquired a large fortune by uncertain means.  The accounts of the West Indian expedition were hopelessly disorganized; there were accusations of embezzlement.  His widow, Marie Thérèse Pollet (24 March 1672 – 1740) was forced to pay back a large part of her inheritance.

D'Iberville was perhaps the first great soldier born in Canada.  Students of the art of war may see his career as an example of the importance of following up after a victory, for he won all his battles but never was able to consolidate what he had won.

# Richard Lewis (English MP)

# Mangammal

Mangammal’s death (circa 1705) is shrouded in mystery. Managammal’s grandson Vijaya Ranga Chokkanatha Nayak came of age in 1704—1705. 
But she is the most remembered of all Nayak rulers by the people of Tamil Nadu even more than Thirumalai Nayak for her administrative works which still exists in various parts of her former kingdom. The belief was that women were not suited to succeed to the throne of a kingdom, so Mangammal shines almost alone as an able and powerful female ruler in Tamil Nadu.
