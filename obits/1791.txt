# James Alms

Alms's health broke down over the winter, and he was forced to go ashore at Madras for several months. This marked the end of his active service, and he returned to England, arriving at Spithead in June 1784. Alms retired to his house at Chichester and died there on 8 June 1791 at the age of 64, survived by his wife and five children. His eldest son on his death was a lieutenant aboard HMS St George, serving Rear-Admiral Sir Richard King, one of Alms's friends from his days in India. Alms was buried at Chichester Cathedral on 14 June 1791.

# Étienne Avril

Avril resided on the rue de Charenton in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine of Paris. He died on June 24, 1791.

# Thomas Blacklock

He died at his home in Crichton Street (off Chapel Street), Edinburgh, and was buried in the adjacent churchyard of St Cuthbert's Chapel of Ease on Buccleuch Street. The grave lies on the west wall slightly to the north-west of the church.

# Francis Brerewood

Francis Brerewood died penurious in 1781, having lived in serious financial straits for at least thirty years. In his will, dated 7 July 1781, in which he styled himself as being "of St George The Martyr, London", he left what remained of his possessions to his widow Mary.

# Pierre Brigot

In 1785, he chose Nicolas Champenois as coadjutor and consecrated him as the Titular Bishop of Doliche on November 5, 1786. Because of old age and sickness, he entrusted the administration to his coadjutor. He died in Pondicherry on November 8, 1791.

# George Bryan

Bryan died in 1791. His burial site is in Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia PA.

# William Bryant (convict)

On 15 September however another four small boats arrived in Kupang, carrying Captain Edward Edwards and the remains of the crew of HMS Pandora, sunk off the Barrier Reef, as well as ten Bounty mutineers whom he had captured and who had survived the wreck. Although accounts differ as to exactly what happened, it was around this time that the authorities became suspicious of Bryant and his party, they were discovered to be escaped convicts and imprisoned. Even in prison they were not badly treated, the men being allowed out to work two at a time. On 5 October they, all in good health, were handed over to Edwards who had chartered the Rembang to take his crew and the Bounty mutineers on to Batavia, from where he could find passages for them to the Cape of Good Hope. On the Rembang the prisoners were subjected to the harsh conditions that Edwards was notorious for and were put in chains and given only enough food to prevent starvation. The captain of the Rembang had offered to provide a cabin for Mary Bryant and the children but Edwards refused the offer. When the Rembang arrived in Batavia a month later some of the convicts, including Bryant, were already suffering from fever and were moved ashore to the Dutch East India Company Hospital. Mary Bryant was allowed to accompany her sick son and husband. Bryant's son Emmanuel died in the hospital 1 December 1791.

Bryant died in the Dutch East India Company Hospital in Batavia on 22 December 1791, three weeks after the death of his son.

# John Henry Cox

Cox did not live long enough to really enjoy the fortune he had amassed and died aged 41 years, on 5 October 1791 and was buried the following day on French Island that lay within sight of the ships moored at Whampoa, and was where all foreigners who died at Canton, or aboard the ships, were interred at the end of the 18th century.

# Henry Gladwin

Henry Gladwin died on 22 June 1791 at Stubbing Court, Derbyshire. His obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine for July 1791 was as follows:

Gladwin was buried in Wingerworth Church, and his monument there survives inscribed as follows:

# Francis Grose

While on an expedition to Ireland to collect antiquarian material, Grose died in Dublin, at the house of Horace Hone, of an apoplectic stroke. He was buried on 18 May 1791, at Drumcondra cemetery. His nephew Daniel and a Dr. Edward Ledwich, who had already published a book on Irish antiquities, completed the final volume of Grose's Antiquities of Ireland in 1791.

# Robert Hairston

Robert Hairston died in 1791 at farm called "Runnett Bag", in Franklin County. Ruth Stovall Hairston died in 1808. At the time of his death in 1791, he owned 1,684 acres of land and twenty-two slaves. He was one of the richest men in Franklin County, and after all his bequests were distributed, his estate was worth £499.1.6 (499 pounds, one shilling, sixpence). Like most families of this age in the Virginia Piedmont, their valuables were held in their lands and slaves. Except for a silver watch, no gold or silver was part of the Hairston estate, and no paintings, carriages or billiard tables are listed in the estate inventory. Much of his land had already been given to his children before his death, and each daughter specifically had been given a farm in their own names. "Hairston endowed each of his daughters- as did most fathers who were able to do so- with her own estate to control independently of her present or future husband."

It is believed that Robert and his wife Ruth are buried under the waters of the present day Philpott Dam, which was completed in 1952. The headstones of Robert and Ruth's graves were relocated to high ground, but not their remains. There were 19 cemeteries covered by Philpott Lake."

# Frederick Haldimand

In the summer of 1784, Frederick Haldimand returned to England, on leave, but he was not to return to Quebec, as he was eventually formally replaced by General Carleton.  In 1785, he was awarded the Order of the Bath.  He settled in London, but made regular visits to his boyhood home, where he died, on June 5, 1791, while on one of his visits.  Haldimand never married, and his diaries show no evidence of romantic interests.[citation needed]

# Benjamin Harrison V

In 1788, Harrison participated as a member of the Virginia Ratifying Convention for the Constitution. However, he was skeptical of a large central government and opposed the constitution because of the absence of a bill of rights, along with Patrick Henry and others. 

He continued his work in the House until he died in April 1791 at his home, after a dinner party celebrating his final electoral success. He is the namesake of a residence hall at the College of William and Mary, as well as a primary bridge spanning the James River at Jordan’s Point near Hopewell, Va.

# Daniel Houghton

In July 1793, reports finally arrived in London confirming that Houghton had died in Africa. As the circumstances were pieced together, it appeared that Houghton had been discouraged from taking the direct route to Timbuktu. He had thus decided to travel through the desert to Tisheet in the north. But two days into the Sahara, Houghton feared that his travelling companions intended to kill him. He turned back south, alone and without any food or water, and made it to a watering-hole called Tarra. The natives camped there refused him any sustenance, and Houghton died there of starvation. His corpse was left unburied to be eaten by scavengers.

# Frantisek Kotzwara

On September 2, 1791 while he was in London, Kotzwara visited a prostitute named Susannah Hill in Vine Street, Westminster. After dinner with her in her lodgings, Kotzwara paid her two shillings and requested that she cut off his testicles.  Hill refused to do so. Kotzwara then tied a ligature around the doorknob, the other end fastened around his neck, and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with Hill. After it was over, Kotzwara was dead. His is one of the first recorded deaths from erotic asphyxiation.

Susannah Hill was tried on September 16 for Kotzwara's murder at the Old Bailey but was acquitted as the jury accepted her testimony about the nature of Kotzwara's death. The court records of the case were supposedly destroyed in order to avoid a public scandal, though it is likely that some kind of copy was made. It is believed that this copy was used to produce a pamphlet about the incident, including Hill's account of the event. A 2005 radio competition organised by the Radio Prague station led a listener to reveal that these court records had in fact not been destroyed, and somehow found their way to the Francis Countway Library of Medicine in Boston.

In 1984 a paper about Kotzwara's death was published in the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology, entitled "The sticky end of Frantisek Koczwara, composer of The Battle of Prague". A pamphlet, Modern Propensities, with details of the trial and an article about auto-erotic asphyxiation was published in London about 1797.

# Lady Catherine Bruce of Clackmannan

She died in 1791. Her life's story was included in the Walking Theatre Company's production of Tales of Clackmannan which celebrated the history of Clackmannanshire.

She has a Scottish country dancing reel named after her called Lady Catherine Bruce's Reel. Clackmannanshire Council owns a painting of her which is attributed the school of the Scottish painter David Allan.

# Charles McKnight

After the war ended, McKnight settled in New York City, where he married Mary Morin Scott, daughter of General John Morin Scott. He opened a private practice and was one of the first physicians to use a carriage to visit his patients.  McKnight published only one article, the surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy, but the piece was cited later by the Medical Society of London in its London Medical Observations and Inquiries.

On November 26, 1784, McKnight was appointed one of the first regents of the University of the State of New York. In 1785, McKnight became professor of anatomy and surgery at Columbia College (now the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons), which his father-in-law co-founded. He also was appointed Port Physician of New York. McKnight was remembered as an oculist, and therefore probably performed eye surgery.  McKnight maintained a steady surgical practice and held his professorship until his death from pneumonia, the result of an old war injury, on November 16, 1791 at age 41.

McKnight was interred at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway in Lower Manhattan, just beyond the gates of the historic Trinity Churchyard, next to his wife, Mary, and her father. They left four daughters and one son, John Morin Scott McKnight, who also became a physician.

# Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau

Mirabeau's health had been damaged by the excesses of his youth and his strenuous work in politics, and in 1791, he contracted pericarditis. With the continuous medical attention paid to him by his friend and physician Pierre Jean George Cabanis, Mirabeau survived to perform his duties as president of the National Assembly until his death on 2 April 1791 in Paris.  Even close to the end, he directed debates with eloquence that further increased his popularity.  The people of Paris cherished him as one of the fathers of the Revolution. During the Trial of Louis XVI in 1792, Mirabeau's dealings with the royal court were brought to light, and he was largely discredited by the public after it became known that he had secretly acted as an intermediary between the monarchy and the revolutionaries and had taken payment for it. Historians in the 21st century discovered secret documents in the archives of Vienna that demonstrate that the Austrian ambassador orchestrated the meetings with the king and queen. Florimond-Claude, comte de Mercy-Argenteau, the ambassador, was the queen's political advisor, with advice tailored to the needs of Austria, not France.

He received a grand burial, and it was for him that the Panthéon in Paris was created as a burial place for great Frenchmen. The street where he died (rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin) was renamed rue Mirabeau. In 1792, his secret dealings with the king were uncovered, and in 1794 his remains were removed from the Panthéon and were replaced with those of Jean-Paul Marat. His remains were then buried anonymously in the graveyard of Clamart. In spite of searches performed in 1889, they were not found.

With Mirabeau's death the task of saving the monarchy became much more difficult, as the king was less reconciled than he had ever been with the Revolution, and thus revolutionary leaders became less willing to share power with a king who proved so unwilling to compromise. Some historians, such as Francois Furet, however, believe that even had he lived, there would have been a similar outcome, as it would have been extremely difficult to remake the old monarchy in harmony with the growing democratic ideals of the age. 

Mirabeau proved himself as one of the strongest early leaders of the revolution. His energy captivated his audience, his leadership was often the lead of the revolutionary ideas, while his work with the king stained his image. Mirabeau's early life, though filled with the ideas of a young man revolting against a stern father, helped give him these qualities.

# George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford

# Rachael Pringle Polgreen

Polgreen was buried in the churchyard of the Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels in Bridgetown on 23 July 1791.

Her legacy has been used repeatedly in Bajan historiography to represent different images at different times. In the nineteenth century, her story was exploited as a cautionary tale for the dangers of not curtailing the sexuality of black women. In the post-colonial period, Polgreen's story was used by elites to foster a sense of the benefits to be gained by accommodation and loyalty to Britain. Still later, she began to symbolize the power that black women were able to wield in resistance to slavery.

Current scholarship is reevaluating her story once again to ascertain how the complexities of her life, such as her own sexual abuse and then sexual exploitation of others, living under the threat of punishment and then domination of others, interacted, keeping in mind that the discourse is colored by the facts that she was an illiterate woman of color and did not tell her own story.

# Grigory Potemkin

Potemkin fell ill in the fever-ridden city of Jassy, though he kept busy, overseeing peace talks,[nb 5] planning his assault on Poland and preparing the army for renewed war in the south. He fasted briefly and recovered some strength, but refused medicine and began to feast once again, consuming a "ham, a slated goose and three or four chickens". On October 13 [O.S. October 2], he felt better and dictated a letter to Catherine before collapsing once more. Later, he awoke and dispatched his entourage to Nikolayev. On October 16 [O.S. October 5] 1791 Potemkin died in the open steppe, 60 km from Jassy. Picking up on contemporary rumor, historians such as the Polish Jerzy Łojek have suggested that he was poisoned because his madness made him a liability, but this is rejected by Montefiore, who suggests he succumbed to bronchial pneumonia instead.

Potemkin was embalmed and a funeral was held for him in Jassy. Eight days after his death, he was buried. Catherine was distraught and ordered social life in St. Petersburg be put on hold. Derzhavin's ode Waterfall lamented his death; likewise many in the military establishment had looked upon Potemkin as a father figure and were especially saddened by his death. Polish contemporary Stanisław Małachowski claimed that Aleksandra von Engelhardt, a niece of Potemkin and wife to Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, a magnate and prominent leader of the Targowica Confederation, also worried for the fate of Poland after the death of the man who had planned to revitalise the Polish state with him as its new head. Potemkin had used the state treasury as a personal bank, preventing the resolution of his financial affairs to this day. Catherine purchased the Tauride Palace and his art collection from his estate, and paid off his debts. Consequently, he left a relative fortune. Catherine's son Paul, who succeeded to the throne in 1796, attempted to undo as many of Potemkin's reforms as possible. The Tauride Palace was turned into a barracks, and the city of Gregoripol, which had been named in Potemkin's honor, was renamed.

Potemkin's grave survived a destruction order issued by Paul and was eventually displayed by the Bolsheviks. His remains now appear to lie in his tomb at St. Catherine's Cathedral in Kherson. The exact whereabouts of some of his internal organs, including his heart and brain first kept at Golia Monastery in Jassy, remain unknown.

# James Rae (surgeon)

He lived his final years at Castlehill, the upper section of the Royal Mile.

He died in 1791, and was buried in the tomb of his forefathers in Greyfriars Kirk. His wife, Isabella Cant died the next year and was buried with him.

The grave lies mid-way along the eastern boundary wall.

# Anna Charlotta Schröderheim

In 1790, Charlotta was pregnant by Seele. In contrast to his usual behavior, Schröderheim demanded a divorce and declared that the child was not his and would be taken from her and registered as dead after the birth. It became a scandal. The reason for the changed behavior of her husband was said to be the king: during a political disagreement, Gustav III, made a remark about her childless marriage and her latest interest in Bruse, one of his stable masters, upon which she answered him: "Your Majesty, we can not afford to keep an equerry"

This remark deeply offended the King, who quite correctly took it as a remark about his and the queen's rumored relationship with the royal stable master, equerry Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila: the rumor at the time claimed that the King had asked Munck to impregnate the queen.

The sympathies was largely on Anna Charlotta's side during the scandal. She gave birth to a daughter 1 January 1791 and died "of sorrow" after the childbirth. In 1796, Elsa Fougt gave a memorial speech to her in the order Stora Amaranther-orden:

Her daughter, Charlotte Schröderheim, was raised as a foster-child at the home of her close friend, Beata Elisabeth Théel (1744–1805). In her memorial speech over Anna Charlotta Schröderheim, which can be described as a forceful defense of a controversial woman, Elsa Fougt describes her a person of great intellectual abilities who could have become much more if the attitude toward women had been more liberal: "the learned Utile Dulci was honored to count her among its members. How worthy was she not of this calling, and how long she could have gone in the learned professions, had she seen them as becoming of her sex"

# John Wesley

Wesley's health declined sharply towards the end of his life and he ceased preaching. On 28 June 1790, less than a year before his death, he wrote:

Wesley died on 2 March 1791, at the age of 87. As he lay dying, his friends gathered around him, Wesley grasped their hands and said repeatedly, "Farewell, farewell."  At the end, he said, "The best of all is, God is with us", lifted his arms and raised his feeble voice again, repeating the words, "The best of all is, God is with us." He was entombed at his chapel on City Road, London.

Because of his charitable nature he died poor, leaving as the result of his life's work 135,000 members and 541 itinerant preachers under the name "Methodist". It has been said that "when John Wesley was carried to his grave, he left behind him a good library of books, a well-worn clergyman's gown" and the Methodist Church.

# William Williams (artist)

He died in the Merchants' and Sailors' Almshouse in Bristol in 1791.

Williams left his personal property to Thomas Eagles, a gentleman who helped him gain admission to the almshouse, where he lived until his death.  The bequest included many books, a self-portrait (now in the Winterthur Museum) and the manuscript of Penrose. The Rev. John Eagles, son of Thomas, prepared an edited copy of this for publication, including 37 watercolours mainly by Nicholas Pocock, intended for engraving. This Eagles version appeared in 1815, but without the illustrations, and in 2006 its manuscript was acquired by the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, UK. Williams' original manuscript, bequeathed to Eagles senior, is at the Indiana University at Bloomington. The manuscript was transcribed and published in 1969 by David Howard Dickason.
