Atike Sultan died on 2 April 1738 in the Çağaloğlu Palace, and was buried in New Mosque, Istanbul.

# Sir Edmund Bacon, 5th Baronet

Bacon died at Bath, Somerset on 4 October 1738, and was buried at Gillingham, Norfolk, two weeks later.  He and his wife had a daughter and two sons, and his only surviving son, Edmund, succeeded to the baronetcy.

# Sir Charles Blois, 1st Baronet

# Charles III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach

Charles William died in Karlsruhe in 1738, when he was planting and hoeing his tulip bed and suddenly suffered a stroke.  His body was interred in the crypt of the Concordia Church in Karlsruhe, in accordance with his last will.  His guts and heart were removed and buried in the crypt of the Castle Church in Pforzheim.  The capsule containing his heart, which was deposited in his widow's coffin, is now missing.

Up to this day, a pyramid at the Marktplatz (market square) stands over the location where the remains of the Margrave lie.  On the pyramid, his birthday is mistakenly stated as 18 January 1679, because after the switch to the Gregorian calendar in 1700 (which did not change the General Roman Calendar), Charles William celebrated his birthday together with his name-day on 27 January, rather than on the 28th (which would correspond to the 17th on the Julian Calendar).

Because his son Frederick of Baden-Durlach had died while Charles William was still alive, his grandson Charles Frederick became his successor. Since he was only 10 years old, a regency had to be established under the legal guardianship of Charles August of Baden-Durlach.

# Anthony Hammond

Hammond died in the Fleet in 1738, but his estate was not administered until 8 April 1749. He married, 14 August 1694, at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Jane, daughter of Sir Walter Clarges, 1st Baronet, and by this lady, who died in 1749, he had two sons: Thomas, who died childless about 1758; James Hammond (1710–1742), and a daughter, Amy, who married first, in 1719, William Dowdeswell of Pull Court, Worcestershire; and secondly, on 7 May 1730, Noel Broxholme, M.D.

Thomas Hammond sold Somersham Place to the Duke of Manchester. Thomas Cooke, who formed Hammond's acquaintanceship in 1722, called him a flatterer of literary men. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society 30 November 1698 but had withdrawn by 1718.  According to Thomas Hearne, Hammond attempted to assassinate the Old Pretender in 1715.

# Hatice Sultan (daughter of Ahmed III)

# Joseph Jekyll

On 19 August 1738 he died of "a mortification in the bowels", and was buried in the Rolls Chapel. He had no children. In his will he left £20,000 to help pay off the national debt, something Lord Mansfield described as "a very foolish bequest.. he might as well have attempted to stop the middle arch of Blackfriars Bridge with his full-bottomed wig".

# Thomas Medlycott (1662–1738)

Medlycott died before September 1738, leaving two sons and a daughter by his wife Sarah. However he left most of his estate in trust for Thomas John Medlycott, apparently an illegitimate son.

# Thomas Sheridan (divine)

Sheridan collapsed and died suddenly while having dinner at a friend's house in Rathfarnham, County Dublin.

Swift before their final quarrel called him the best scholar in Ireland; Sir Walter Scott in his Life of Swift calls him "good- natured and light- hearted."

# Louis Timothee

Timothy arranged with Benjamin Franklin to revive the South Carolina Gazette weekly newspaper. He went to Charleston by himself in the later part of 1733.  He started publishing the newspaper on 2 February 1734. Timothy followed later from Philadelphia and went to Charleston in the spring of 1734. She came to Charleston with her six children, four of which were children born in the Netherlands. This was the year Timothy anglicized his name to "Lewis Timothy", being three years after arriving to America.

In Franklin's Philadelphia shop Timothy continued Whitmarsh's practice of reprinting essays encouraging people to be optimistic and virtuous. One day in 1738 Timothy informed his readers that his publication of a pamphlet was delayed "by reason of Sicknes, myself and Son having been visited with this Fever, that reigns at present, so that neither of us hath been capable for some time of working much at the Press." Timothy died two months after this announcement. He may have contracted the deadly yellow fever, but there are no records to show this for sure. In fact on January 4, 1739, the South-Carolina Gazette noted that the cause of his death was "an unhappy accident."

Timothy had anticipated the likelihood of his own demise because three previous South Carolina printers had died soon after arriving in the colony. He had put in a special clause inserted in the Franklin partnership contract that his eldest son Peter could succeed him if he prematurely died. Peter was just thirteen years old when Timothy died. He was then training as an apprentice with his father, however was too inexperienced yet to take over the business. Franklin agreed to take on Elizabeth Timothy, the wife of Timothy, as a partner until Peter was capable of running the shop.  When Elizabeth became Franklin's printer partner she had six children. Peter took over a portion of the  South-Carolina Gazette  newspaper publication in 1740 and the complete printing business in 1746 that included the newspaper and printing of government works as the official "public printer" for the colony of South Carolina. When Peter was twenty-one years old he took over the partnership his father had with Franklin and worked closely with Franklin for over the next thirty years.

# Joseph Wasse

Wasse died unmarried on 19 November 1738. Part of his library was acquired by his successor at Aynhoe, Dr. Francis Yarborough, later principal of Brasenose College, Oxford (1745–1770). The books, with manuscript notes by Wasse, were given by Yarborough's heirs to the college. Wasse's copy of Thucydides, with many notes, went to the Bodleian Library.

# Isaac Winslow

He died in Marshfield on December 14, 1738, having named as his heirs his wife Sarah, his sons John and Edward, and his daughters Penelope and Elizabeth. He is buried in the Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts, not far from the house that he built in 1699.
