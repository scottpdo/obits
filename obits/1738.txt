# Charles III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach

  pyramid on the market square


Charles William died in Karlsruhe in 1738, when he was planting and hoeing his tulip bed and suddenly suffered a stroke.  His body was interred in the crypt of the Concordia Church in Karlsruhe, in accordance with his last will.  His guts and heart were removed and buried in the crypt of the Castle Church in Pforzheim.  The capsule containing his heart, which was deposited in his widow's coffin, is now missing.

Up to this day, a pyramid at the Marktplatz (market square) stands over the location where the remains of the Margrave lie.  On the pyramid, his birthday is mistakenly stated as 18 January 1679, because after the switch to the Gregorian calendar in 1700 (which did not change the General Roman Calendar), Charles William celebrated his birthday together with his name-day on 27 January, rather than on the 28th (which would correspond to the 17th on the Julian Calendar).

Because his son Frederick of Baden-Durlach had died while Charles William was still alive, his grandson Charles Frederick became his successor. Since he was only 10 years old, a regency had to be established under the legal guardianship of Charles August of Baden-Durlach.

# Anthony Hammond

Hammond died in the Fleet in 1738, but his estate was not administered until 8 April 1749. He married, 14 August 1694, at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Jane, daughter of Sir Walter Clarges, 1st Baronet, and by this lady, who died in 1749, he had two sons: Thomas, who died childless about 1758; James Hammond (1710–1742), and a daughter, Amy, who married first, in 1719, William Dowdeswell of Pull Court, Worcestershire; and secondly, on 7 May 1730, Noel Broxholme, M.D.

Thomas Hammond sold Somersham Place to the Duke of Manchester. Thomas Cooke, who formed Hammond's acquaintanceship in 1722, called him a flatterer of literary men. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society 30 November 1698 but had withdrawn by 1718.  According to Thomas Hearne, Hammond attempted to assassinate the Old Pretender in 1715.

# Hatice Sultan (daughter of Ahmed III)

# Joseph Jekyll

On 19 August 1738 he died of "a mortification in the bowels", and was buried in the Rolls Chapel. He had no children. In his will he left £20,000 to help pay off the national debt, something Lord Mansfield described as "a very foolish bequest.. he might as well have attempted to stop the middle arch of Blackfriars Bridge with his full-bottomed wig".
