# Lewis Atterbury (chaplain)

At the age of seventy, up to which time he had enjoyed good health, he suffered an attack of the palsy and began to pay frequent visits to Bath, Somerset. Here he died 20 October 1731, in his seventy-sixth year. He was buried in Highgate Chapel. He left a collection of pamphlets, in some two hundred volumes, to the library of Christ Church, Oxford, and some books to the libraries at Bedford and Newport Pagnell. To his brother, the bishop, he left one hundred pounds; and the remainder of his property, first to his granddaughter (who survived him only a short time), and afterwards to his nephew Osborn, the bishop's son. He also left ten pounds a year for the support of a schoolmistress for girls at Newport Pagnell.

# Sir William Barker, 5th Baronet

Barker married as his second wife Anne Spencer, widow of Edward Spencer, of Rendlesham, Suffolk, at St Marylebone Church, London,  on 9 February 1731. A few months later, he died on 23 July 1731 at his house in East Street, near Red Lion Square.  He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Sir John Barker, 6th Baronet, his only child by his first wife. He also left £500 in his will to provide for the upbringing and apprenticeship ofCharles King, offspring of Mary King, who may have been his illegitimate son.

# Cornelia Zangheri Bandi

According to the 1745 issue by the correspondent Paul Rolli (who translated, for the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, a 1731 study by the Veronese historian Giuseppe Bianchini: Parere Sopra la Cagione della Morte della Signora Contessa Cornelia Zangari Ne' Bandi Cesenate), during her last dinner, the 66 years-old Countess was "dull and heavy". Some account reports that the Countess was a brandy driker, and that she used to sprinkle camphorated brandy on her body too to relieve some physical pain. The maid accompanied her to her room, and the two spent over three hours chatting and praying. The maid left her mistress already asleep. The next day, when she did not get up at the usual time, she went to wake her and found the remains of the Countess. The room was full of soot. The body of the countess had been reduced to a pile of ashes that was a little more than 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) from the bed, although her lower legs below the knee, three fingers and front of her skull were relatively intact. The bed and the rest of the furniture had not been affected by the fire, but were covered by a greasy and smelly layer. On the floor there was an oil lamp covered with ashes, but without oil. The way the sheets were found seemed to indicate that the Countess had risen at some point during the night. The full account by Paul Rolli: 

The case of Cornelia Zangheri Bandi is frequently described as possible spontaneous human combustion. Charles Dickens, in his preface to Bleak House (1852/1853), writes about the Countess (whom he misnames Countess Cornelia de Baudi Cesenate) with regard to the "possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion."

# Daniel Defoe

Daniel Defoe died on 24 April 1731, probably while in hiding from his creditors. He often was in debtors' prison. The cause of his death was labelled as lethargy, but he probably experienced a stroke. He was interred in Bunhill Fields (today Bunhill Fields Burial and Gardens), Borough of Islington, London, where a monument was erected to his memory in 1870.

Defoe is known to have used at least 198 pen names.

# John Fownes

Fownes died on 4 October 1731 and was buried at Brixham. He had two surviving sons and one surviving daughter. His eldest son was:

Fownes presented to St Mary's Church, Brixham, a 44 ounce silver flagon dated 1704 with a Dublin hallmark. In the Nethway Chapel at the east end of the south aisle of St Mary's Church, Brixham, are buried Thomas Fownes, Vicar 1755-1809, and others of the Fownes family, and several mural monuments to the Fownes and Luttrell families.

# István Koháry

István Koháry remained unmarried and died highly honoured at the age of 82 at Csábrág castle.  In his testament he founded a Fideicommis and stated that every head of it have to be a catholic. His nephew  Andreas Josef Koháry (1694–1757) became his heir.
István Koháry was buried in the family crypt at the abbey of Hronský Beňadik. 1909 Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria commissioned a marble monument for the church to honour his famous ancestor.

Lloyd died April 6, 1731 in Chester, Pennsylvania and is interred at old St. Paul's Church burial ground.  Lloyd and his wife Grace were originally interred at the Quaker burial ground in Chester, but were moved to St. Paul's after the Quaker burial ground was removed to make way for new development on October, 1959.

# Humphry Morice (Governor of the Bank of England)

Morice served as Deputy Governor of the Bank of England from 1725 to 1726, and as Governor from 1727 to 1729. During this period, he defrauded the bank of £29,000 by presenting fictitious bills of exchange for discounting by the Bank. He died suddenly on 16 November 1731, possibly of gout, but he was widely believed to have poisoned himself to forestall exposure. After his death, the enormous extent of his defalcations was revealed: he had not only swindled the Bank, but abstracted money from a trust fund left for his daughters by their maternal uncle, and still left debts of nearly £150,000. The Bank took action against his widow to attempt to recover its losses, ultimately settling for £12,000 after forty-three years of litigation.

# Elizabeth Needham

In late 1730, Sir John Gonson, a Justice of the Peace and fervent supporter of the Society for the Reformation of Manners, spurred on by the furore surrounding the Charteris rape case, began conducting raids on brothels all over London. By early 1731 he had arrived at St James, where some residents of Park Place reported "a Notorious Disorderly House in that Neighbourhood". In truth, Needham's house was hardly unknown, having served the upper echelons of society for years, but she was arrested by Gonson and committed to the Gatehouse by Justice Railton.

On 29 April 1731, Needham was convicted of keeping a disorderly house, fined one shilling, and sentenced to stand twice in the pillory, and "to find sureties for her good behaviour for 3 years". On 30 April she was taken to the pillory near Park Place to stand for the first time. Perhaps because of her connections, she was allowed to lie face down in front of the pillory and a number of guards were paid to protect her. Despite this she received such a pelting that it was thought likely she would die before her punishment was completed. The crowds that had gathered to see her pilloried were so large that one boy fell on an iron fencing rail while trying to get a better look and was killed.

Needham was taken from the pillory alive, but died on 3 May 1731, the day before she was due to stand in the pillory (this time at New Palace Yard) for the second time. With her last words she apparently expressed great fear at having to stand in the pillory again after the severe punishment she had received the first time. The Grub Street Journal, the satirical journal allied with Alexander Pope and others of Hogarth's friends, sardonically reported that the populace "acted very ungratefully, considering how much she had done to oblige them". Her demise was celebrated in a mocking rhyme:

Hogarth was still at work on A Harlot's Progress when she died, so she never saw herself immortalised. There were other madams ready to step into her shoes, but it was not until Mother Douglas took over the King's Head in Covent Garden in 1741 that a brothel reappeared with a reputation to match that of Needham.

# John Pocklington (MP)

Pocklington died on 22 October 1731 and was buried in Finglas. He had one son, Christopher,  who became an Admiral  in the Irish Navy. Christopher  married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Domvile, and  heiress of the Domvile baronets. Their descendants, who took the Domvile name, inherited the  substantial Domvile estates in County Dublin, and were later made  the Domvile baronets  of the second creation.

# Cecilia Rosa de Jesús Talangpaz

Cecilia died in 1731, followed by her sister Dionisia in 1732.

# Ned Ward

On 20 June 1731 Ward died and was buried in Old St. Pancras Churchyard in north London on 27 June. His grave is lost and he is not listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial to important lost graves therein. His obituary in Abbleby's Journal of 28 September 1731 published the names of his wife and children, but there is no record of his marriage.

# Charles Wither

Wither died on 20 November 1731, and was buried at Deane. He left three surviving daughters, a son and daughter having predeceased him. His wife Frances died in 1752, followed a day later by her eldest daughter Dorothy. Their second daughter Henrietta Maria.married Edmund Bramston and succeeded to Oakley Hall. They were the parents of  Wither Bramston  who rebuilt the Hall. Charles Wither’s third daughter Ann married her cousin William Beech whereby Oakley Hall came into the Beech family in 1832.
