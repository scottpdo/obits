# Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden

Adolf Frederick died in Stockholm on 12 February 1771 after having consumed a meal consisting of lobster, caviar, sauerkraut, kippers and champagne, which was topped off with 14 servings of his favourite dessert: hetvägg made of semla and served in a bowl of hot milk .

The king was regarded, both during his time and in later times, as dependent on others, a weak ruler and lacking of any talents. But he was allegedly also a good husband, a caring father, and a gentle master to his servants. His favourite pastime was to make snuffboxes, which he allegedly spent a great deal of time doing. His personal hospitality and friendliness were witnessed by many who deeply mourned him at his death.

Following his death, his son Gustav III seized power in 1772 in a military coup d'état, reinstating absolute rule.

# Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore

Calvert never returned to his native England. He remained on the continent, "constantly moving ... that he might not know where he should be buried", and it was in Naples in September 1771 that he contracted a fever and died. His body was returned to London, lying in state at the Great Room of Exeter Exchange, Strand, and was interred in his family's vault at St. Martin's "with much funeral pomp, the cavalcade extending from the church to the eastern extremity of Epsom". According to Gentleman's Quarterly: "His Lordship had injured his character in his life by seduction, so that the populace paid no regard to his memory when dead, but plundered the room where his body lay the moment it was removed".

He was buried in Epsom, Surrey.

# John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford

His health had been declining for some years, and in 1770 he became partially paralysed. He died at Woburn on 5 January 1771, and was buried in the 'Bedford Chapel' at St. Michael's Church, Chenies, Buckinghamshire. His sons all predeceased him, and he was succeeded in the title by his grandson, Francis.

The duke held many public offices: lord-lieutenant of Bedfordshire and Devon, and chancellor of Dublin University among others, and was a Knight of the Garter. Bedford was a proud and conceited man, but possessed both ability and common-sense. The important part which he took in public life, however, was due rather to his wealth and position than to his personal taste or ambition. He was neither above nor below the standard of political morality of the time, and was influenced by his duchess, who was very ambitious, and by followers who were singularly unscrupulous.

He served as the twelfth Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin from 1765 to 1770.

# John Burton (antiquary)

Burton died in the parish of Holy Trinity Church, Micklegate, York, on 19 January 1771, and Mary Burton died on 28 October following. At his death he was living in or near Micklegate in York; he was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Micklegate, York, on 21 January. Burton is commonly supposed to have resembled Laurence Sterne's satirical description of him the novel Tristram Shandy as the character Dr Slop: "a little, squat, uncourtly figure...of about four feet and a half perpendicular height, with a breadth of back, and a sesquipedality of belly". However, a sworn testimony of 1746 describes him as "a tall Well sett Gentleman".

# Prince Eunsin

In December 1777, he was posthumously reinstated to his former standing by his half-brother King Jeongjo, but only after he was adopted by Prince Nakcheon, Prince Yeonryong's family.

In 1819, his half-nephew King Sunjo of Joseon adopted the child, Yi Chae-jung, after dying without an issue. Yi Chae-jung was the son of Yi Byeong-won, an eighth generation descendant of Prince Neungwon, a son of Grand Prince Jeongwon. 

Grand Prince Jeongwon was the 5th illegitimate son of King Seonjo. Yi Chae-jung changed his name from Chae-jung to Yi Gu and was also appointed as Prince Namyeon. On December 12, 1779, he was posthumously given the honor of Duke of Somin (소민공 昭愍公). 

On  February 28, 1871 his title was change to Duke of Chungheon (충헌공 忠獻公).

# Charles Exshaw

# Thomas Gray

Gray died on 30 July 1771 in Cambridge, and was buried beside his mother in the churchyard of St. Giles' church in Stoke Poges, the setting for his famous Elegy. His grave can still be seen there.

# Charles Green (astronomer)

Following the departure from Tahiti, the Endeavour continued south-westwards as Cook carried out his orders to further explore the Southern Ocean. The expedition reached New Zealand in October 1769, giving Green an opportunity to observe the transit of Mercury from land. A landing was made at an inlet that would be subsequently called Mercury Bay on  3 November; the transit was successfully observed by Green on November 9.

On reaching Australia, and during Cook's voyage along the coast, he named an island, Green Island, after the astronomer in June 1770. Green, by this time had contracted scurvy.

The Endeavour was forced to make for  Batavia (present-day Jakarta) for repairs.  Disease were rife in the Dutch-controlled city, including malaria and dysentery; Green contracted the latter, dying on 29 January 1771, twelve days after the ship's departure from the port. Cook, in recording Green's death in his log, went on to add that Green had been in ill-health for some time and his lifestyle had contributed to his early death. An account published in a London newspaper described his final hours: "He had been ill some time, and was directed by the surgeon to keep himself warm, but in a fit of phrensy he got up in the night and put his legs out of the portholes, which was the occasion of his death."

# Zachary Hickes

Hickes died of a consumptive lung infection on 26 May 1771, the third anniversary of his commission as lieutenant aboard Endeavour. As Cook recorded in his journal, the cause of Hickes' death was "a Consumption of which he was not free from when we saild from England so that it may be truly said that he hath been dieing ever sence, tho he held out tolerable well until we got to Batavia." His remains were buried at sea off the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, with what Cook described as "the usual ceremonies."

# Lewis Hopkin

Hopkin died 17 November 1771, and was buried in Llandyfodwg churchyard. Two of his bardic pupils, Edward Evans

At some time after his divorce from Rachel, Lavien remarried. With his second wife, he had two sons and a daughter, all of whom died in childhood.:5 Lavien's second wife died in 1768, one month before Rachel's death.

On February 28, 1771, Lavien died in Frederiksted.

# Thomas Martin of Palgrave

Martin was a good lawyer, but he gradually lost his practice. Money troubles meant that he was obliged to sell many of his books and some of his manuscript collections. He died at Palgrave on 7 March 1771, and was buried, with others of his family, in the porch of the parish church, where a small mural monument of white marble, with an English inscription, was erected by his friend Sir John Fenn.

# Benjamin Merrill

In a letter from Governor Tryon to Lord Hillsborough, Tryon asked for consideration to be given to the widow Merrill and her children:

"Benjamin Merrill a Captain of the militia, at the hour of his execution, left it in charge of the officers to solicit me to petition His Majesty to grant his plantation and estate to his wife and eight children. He died under a thorough conviction of his crime and the justice of his sentence, and addressed himself to the spectators to take warning by his suffering. His Majesty's indulgence to this request would, I am persuaded, be dutifully and affectionatley [sic] received by his unhappy widow and children." —Wme. Tryon

The request was granted, although later played down by the Patriots of the Revolution. Merrill and his five companions were hanged on June 19, 1771, near Hillsborough, North Carolina.

# Samuel Phillips (reverend)

Phillips died on June 5, 1771.  Over the course of his ministry, he baptised 2143 people including 30 adults and witnessed the parish grow from 35 in 1711 to 573.  He is the longest serving pastor of the church to date.[citation needed]  He is buried in the South Church Cemetery, Andover, Massachusetts along with other members of the Phillips family.

Richardson died on 23 July 1771. His trustees sold Mount Pleasant to Sir William Henry Ashhurst after Richardson's death.

# Raimondo di Sangro

# Edmund Waller (died 1771)

Waller spent the rest of his life in retirement and died in April 1771. He had four sons and two daughters.  Horace Walpole described him  as a ‘dull obscure person, of great application to figures and the revenue’. His speeches were often unintelligible.
