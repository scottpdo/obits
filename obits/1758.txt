# Charles Apthorp

Apthorp died suddenly in November 1758; he complained "of a slight cold a few minutes before he expired." A New England newspaper described him as "the greatest and most noble merchant on this continent." Twelve days after his death, his funeral was held at King's Chapel. It was "attended by very many gentlemen of distinction and principal inhabitants of the town. The streets and windows of the houses, as the solemnity passed along, were thronged with spectators. ... [At King's Chapel] the Reverend Mr. Caner preached a suitable sermon to a crowded audience."

A wall marker carved by Henry Cheere memorializes Apthorp inside King's Chapel; it "is crowned by a cherub weeping over a cinerary urn."

In a book written in 1910, Apthorp left a fortune equal to $150,000.

After her husband died Grizzel lived near the Central House on Brattle Square [Dock Square at Brattle Street]. She died at 88 years of age in 1796 in the home of her son, John in Quincy. A notice of her death described her as virtuous, amiable, charitable and well-regarded.

# Charles Butler, 1st Earl of Arran

He died at  his lodgings at Whitehall  in December 1758 and was buried in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster.

On his death, the Earldom of Arran, the Barony of Butler (of Weston) and the Jacobite Dukedom of Arran (such as it was) became extinct, along with the Dukedom and Marquessate of Ormonde. The rest of his de jure Irish titles, including the Earldom of Ormonde, passed to his kinsman John Butler, but remained dormant.

His claim to the Barony of Butler (of Moore Park) and the Lordship of Dingwall (both attainted along with the English Dukedom of Ormonde) passed to his niece, Lady Frances Elliot, eldest daughter of the 1st Earl of Grantham and Arran's sister, the former Lady Henrietta Butler, and eventually passed to the Earls Cowper (descendants of Lord Grantham's youngest daughter), the attainder finally being reversed in 1871 in favour of the 7th Earl.

Horace Walpole  called him "an inoffensive old man, last of the illustrious house of Ormonde, and much respected by the Jacobites".

# As'ad Pasha al-Azm

After being deposed, As'ad Pasha was assigned to Aleppo Eyalet and a month after, was appointed Governor of Egypt. In late 1757, the Hajj pilgrim caravan was annihilated. The Ottomans accused As'ad Pasha of inciting the Bedouin to attack the caravan in response to his deposition earlier that year. Consequently, Grand Vizier Raghib Pasha ordered As'ad Pasha's execution. As'ad Pasha was executed in March 1758 aboard a ship ostensibly transporting him to Crete where would live in exile. A Georgian mamluk (slave soldier) of As'ad Pasha, Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, then led Ottoman authorities to the whereabouts of his master's treasures and was rewarded with the governorship of Damascus in 1760.

# Adina Beg

On 15 September 1758, only a few months after his appointment, Adina Beg passed away at Khanpur near Hoshiarpur. The Maratha's appointed Sabaji Bhonsl to succeed him as the governor of the Punjab. A tomb was erected at his grave in Khanpur. His life is described in an unpublished Persian manuscript, the Ahwal-i-Dina Beg Khan.

# Pope Benedict XIV

Benedict XIV had suffered from kidney problems for years.  His health worsened in 1758 and, after a battle with gout, he died on 3 May 1758 at the age of 83.  His final words to those surrounding him on his deathbed were, "I leave you in the hands of God."

Following his funeral, he was interred in Saint Peter's Basilica and a large catafalque was erected in his honour.

# Frederick Francis of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel

On 14 October 1758, the Austrians, commanded by Daun, surprised the Prussians with a pre-dawn assault on the sleeping camp.  James Keith, Frederick's friend and an able general, had organized a defense of the village while Frederick could withdraw from Hochkirch.  This successful action initially repulsed the Austrian advance, giving Frederick hope that the situation could be won.  Even after Keith himself was shot and killed, Frederick still thought the battle could be retrieved and returned to the rear echelons to take command.  Finding his infantry milling about in the village after Keith was killed, Frederick ordered the infantry to advance, sending reinforcements commanded by his brother-in-law with them.  As Francis approached the village, Austrian cannon-fire sheared his head off his shoulders. His troops, demoralized by this sight, faltered.

# Dorothy Boyle, Countess of Burlington

The Countess of Burlington died on 21 September 1758, aged 59.

# Esther Edwards Burr

Just a month after the death of her father (who had come to Princeton to be Burr's successor as President of the College), Esther died on April 7, 1758 after "a few days illness". The illness turned out to be smallpox, and her death left her two children, Aaron and Sarah Burr, as orphans. Aaron Burr, Sr. had died previously in September 1757.

# Robert Clayton (bishop)

Clayton proposed, 2 February 1756, in the Irish House of Lords, that the Athanasian creed and Nicene creed should be removed from the liturgy of the Church of Ireland.
Despite the controversy this aroused, no proceedings were taken against him until the publication of the third part of the 'Vindication of ... the Old and New Testament,' Dublin, 1757, when he renewed his attack on the Trinity and advanced doctrines contrary to the Thirty-nine Articles. Horace Walpole said caustically that his Vindication seemed calculated to destroy anyone's faith in the Testaments. The government, by now seriously alarmed by the heterodoxy of Clayton's opinions, ordered that he be prosecuted for heresy: a meeting of Irish prelates was called at the house of the Primate, and Clayton was summoned to attend. Before the appointed time he died, on 26 February 1758.

Vane died on 6 March 1758. He was succeeded in his titles by his son Henry. With his wife Grace, he had seven children
