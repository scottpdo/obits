# Marie-Anne de Cupis de Camargo

She died on 28 April 1770 in Paris at the age of 60.

# Thomas Chatterton

While walking along St Pancras Churchyard, Chatterton much absorbed in thought, took no notice of an open grave, newly dug in his path, and subsequently tumbled into it. His walking companion, upon observing this event, helped Chatterton and told him in a jocular manner that he was happy in assisting at the resurrection of genius. Chatterton replied, "My dear friend, I have been at war with the grave for some time now." Chatterton would commit suicide three days later. On 24 August 1770, he retired for the last time to his attic in Brook Street, carrying with him the arsenic which he drank, after tearing into fragments whatever literary remains were at hand. He was 17 years and nine months old.

A few days later, one Dr Thomas Fry came to London with the intention of giving financial support to the young boy "whether discoverer or author merely." A fragment, probably one of the last pieces written by the impostor-poet was put together by Dr Fry from the shreds of paper that covered the floor of Thomas Chatterton's Brook Street attic on the morning of 25 August 1770. The would-have-been patron of the poet had an eye for literary forgeries, and purchased the scraps which the poet's landlady, Mrs Angel swept into a box, cherishing the hope of discovering a suicide note among the pieces. This fragment, possibly one of the remnants of Chatterton's very last literary efforts, was identified by Dr Fry to be a modified ending of the poet's tragical interlude Aella. The fragment is now in the possession of Bristol Public Library and Art Gallery.

The final Alexandrine is completely missing, together with Chatterton's notes. However, according to Dr Fry, the character who utters the final lines must have been Birtha, whose last word might have been something like "kisste."

# William Chetwynd, 3rd Viscount Chetwynd

Chetwynd died on 3 April 1770 aged 86. He had two sons and four daughters, but disinherited his surviving son, William, who became the 4th Viscount.

Chetwynd built and lived in Chetwynd House in Stafford, now Stafford Post Office.

# Alexander Colville, 7th Lord Colville of Culross

Colville apparently held no other command and received no further promotion. He died at Drumsheugh in Scotland on 21 May 1770, aged 53.

# Alexander Cruden

Cruden died suddenly while praying in his lodgings in Camden Passage, Islington, on 1 November 1770. He was buried in the ground of a Protestant dissenting congregation in Dead Man's Place, Southwark. He bequeathed a portion of his savings for a bursary at Aberdeen, which preserves his name on the list of benefactors of the university.

# John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont

Lord Perceval died 4 December 1770 at Pall Mall, London, aged 59.

# Arthur Forrest (Royal Navy officer)

In 1769, however, he was sent out to the same station as commander-in-chief, with his broad pennant in HMS Dunkirk. His time in the appointment was short-lived, he died at Jamaica on 26 May 1770. Sadly, at the time of his death, he never knew that advice of his appointment to the rank of admiral and reputedly, elevation to the peerage as the Viscount Forrest, were on a ship from London to Jamaica.

He had married Frederica Marina Cecilia, probably a daughter of Colonel Lynch of Jamaica, by whom he had two sons and five daughters. Mrs. Forrest survived her husband many years, and died in 1802. His eldest daughter, Bridget, married the diarist John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington.

# John Manners, Marquess of Granby

Granby died at Scarborough, Yorkshire, in 1770. The outpouring of grief was real and sustained. His friend and associate Levett Blackborne, a Lincoln's Inn barrister and Manners family adviser who frequently resided at Belvoir, was away at the time, visiting a family relation of Manners' and received the disturbing news on his return to Belvoir. He wrote to George Vernon at Clontarf on 12 February 1771, bemoaning Granby's proclivities that had brought him to ruin:

"You are no stranger to the spirit of procrastination. The noblest mind that ever existed, the amiable man whom we lament was not free from it. This temper plunged him into difficulties, debts and distresses; and I have lived to see the first heir of a subject in the Kingdom have a miserable shifting life, attended by a levee of duns, and at last die broken-hearted."

He is probably best known today for being popularly supposed to have more pubs named after him than any other person - due, it is said, to his practice of setting up old soldiers of his regiment as publicans when they were too old to serve any longer.

# George Grenville

# Thomas Gurney (shorthand writer)

The profession of shorthand-writer or teacher yielded at that time a slender income, and Gurney was glad to continue his business as a clockmaker, and to supplement his income by designing patterns for calico-printing for one of his friends who was a manufacturer. He held his appointment at the Old Bailey till his death on 22 June 1770.

He was succeeded by his half-brother, Nawab Nazim Ashraf Ali Khan as the next Nawab.

# Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair

Father Charles MacDonald in his "Moidart; or Among the Clanranalds" records Alasdair's last moments from the tradition of district:

# Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria (1762–1770)

Just a few months short of her eighth birthday, Archduchess Maria Theresa became ill with pleurisy. Her father, by that time Holy Roman Emperor, did everything in his power to save her and attended her bedside even at night. However, the medicine in those days was highly undeveloped and Archduchess Maria Theresa died on 23 January 1770 from a very high fever. Her father was heartbroken. When Khevenhüller had to disturb Joseph in order to make the arrangements for the funeral, the emperor, with tears in his eyes, told him *he had lost, so to speak, his only consolation and pleasure'.

Below are excerpts from a letter from Joseph to his daughter's governess, the marquise d'Herzelles, written a few hours after the child's death;

If decency permitted, it would be with you alone that I would be pouring out the sorrow which... pierces my soul. I have ceased to be a father: it is more than I can bear. Despite being resigned to it, I cannot stop myself thinking and saying every moment: 'O my God, restore to me my daughter, restore her to me.' I hear her voice, I see her. I was dazed when the terrible blow fell. Only after I had got back to my room did I feel the full horror of it, and I shall go on feeling it all the rest of my life, since I shall miss her in everything...

As my daughter's sole heir, I have just given orders... that I should keep only her diamonds. [You are to have everything else.] One thing that I would ask you to let me have is her white dimity dressing-gown, embroidered with flowers, and some of her writings...

The death of his only and much idolized daughter confirmed Joseph in his growing misanthropy and finished the job of making him a compulsive worker.

The little Archduchess was the second of Maria Theresa's grandchildren to die, after her younger sister. It is said that, even after her death, her father kept her dresses and shoes. She was buried in the Imperial Crypt, in Vienna. Her tomb consists of a beautiful effigy that represents the young Archduchess sleeping on a bed, covered by a blanket, with her hands towards the sky in sign of prayer and surrounded by the Holy Crown of Hungary and the crown of the Holy Roman Emperor.

# Lucy Chester Parke

Parke died in Antigua, and was buried on 20 November 1770, leaving three children, Daniel, Lucy and Elizabeth Dunbar Parke.

# James Parker (publisher)

Parker took over Bradford's position as the official government "public printer" for New York on December 1, 1743.  He was the government "public printer" for New Jersey in 1758. Parker had several controversial issues during the tenure as the government "public printer" of New York and New Jersey. His clients included many of New York City's elite. Parker even acted as Franklin's agent in the business of Franklin & Hall when Franklin went to Europe.

Parker's New York printing business was handed down to his nephew Samuel Parker in February 1759. This business was ultimately taken over by Holt in 1760. Holt was the manager of the Connecticut Gazette that Parker started as the first newspaper in that colony. In 1770, Parker printed a controversial paper by Sons of Liberty leader Alexander McDougall for which he was arrested, however he died shortly thereafter before the settling of the case. Parker suffered many years from gout and died at a friend's house in Burlington, New Jersey, July 2, 1770. Towards the end of Parker's life, many of his business partners took advantage of his poor health and directed most of the profits of the business into their own pockets without sharing with Parker as they should have.

Holt's obituary in the New York Journal (July 5, 1770) says that Parker "was eminent in his Profession", "possessed a sound judgment and extensive knowledge", "was industrious in Business, upright in his Dealings, charitable to the distressed." Holt stated his one time business partner "left a fair Character." Parker's will showed that he bequeathed his three printing press businesses (Burlington, New Haven, Woodbridge) to his son.

# José Antonio Raón y Gutiérrez

In 1770, the Real Audiencia sent Simón de Anda y Salazar to assume Raón's position. Anda arrived in July of the same year to succeed as Governor-General. The subsequent investigation (residencia) into Raón and three other associates, namely Francisco Henriquez de Villacorta, Domingo Blas de Basaraz (special commissioner for the expulsion of Jesuits), and Juan Antonio Cosio (Raón's secretary), was one of Anda's first acts as the new governor. The first two were members of the Real Audiencia of Manila, while the last one was Raón's secretary. The investigation went for almost three years, but he was never convicted and Raón died in Manila on 4 January 1773 before the investigation could be finalized. Raón Street in Manila was named in his honor. Later on, it was renamed as Gonzalo Puyat Street. The namesake was a Filipino industrialist and father of former Senator Gil Puyat.

# John Michael Rysbrack

Rysbrack died in Vere Street, Westminster, in 1770.

# William Stark (physician)

After eight months of experimenting, he died on 23 February 1770, at the age of twenty-nine. His legacy was not a breakthrough discovery but his detailed record keeping indicated the importance of vitamin C to later researchers. Had he heeded the recent discoveries of James Lind, he would have known to include citrus fruits in his experimental diet. Instead he followed Pringle's advice to abstain from salt. His friends attributed his death to the impudent zeal with which he prosecuted his investigations.

James Carmichael Smyth published The works of the late William Stark … consisting of clinical and anatomical observations, with experiments dietetical and statical (1788), eighteen years after his death

# Forby Sutherland

Cook logged that Forby Sutherland died of consumption on the evening of 30 April 1770 while the ship was anchored in the Bay, and was buried ashore at Kurnell the following morning.  He had been afflicted by that condition ever since leaving the Le Maire Strait.  The actual date of burial was 2 May.

Sutherland was an able seaman and also the ship's poulterer (which meant he prepared game birds for the table, including for instance those shot by Joseph Banks and Lieutenant Gore).

# Tupaia (navigator)

In November 1770, Tupaia died from either dysentery or malaria, both of which were present aboard Endeavour during its berthing for repairs in Batavia. Cook recorded his passing in his journal: "He was a Shrewd, Sensible, Ingenious Man, but proud and obstinate which often made his situation on board both disagreeable to himself and those about him, and tended much to promote the deceases that put a period to his life."

# Philip Carteret Webb

Webb died at his seat of Busbridge Hall on 22 June 1770.

# George Whitefield

In 1770, the 55-year-old Whitefield continued preaching in spite of poor health. He said, "I would rather wear out than rust out." His last sermon was preached in a field "atop a large barrel". The next morning Whitefield died in the parsonage of Old South Presbyterian Church, Newburyport, Massachusetts, on 30 September 1770, and was buried, according to his wishes, in a crypt under the pulpit of this church. A bust of Whitefield is in the collection of the Gloucester City Museum & Art Gallery.

It was John Wesley who preached his funeral sermon in London, at Whitefield's request.

Whitefield left almost £1,500 to friends and family. That would be some £185,700 in 2014 pounds. Furthermore, he had deposited £1,000 for his wife if he predeceased her and had contributed £3,300 to the Bethesda Orphanage. "Questions concerning the source of his personal wealth dogged his memory. His will stated that all this money had lately been left him 'in a most unexpected way and unthought of means.'"
