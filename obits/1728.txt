# Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia

On 21 February 1728, Anna gave birth in Kiel Castle to a son named Carl Peter Ulrich, the future Peter III of Russia.

A few days after his birth, the barely twenty-year-old duchess caught puerperal fever (postpartum infection) and died on 4 March 1728. In memory of his wife, Carl Friedrich founded the Order of St Anna, which subsequently became a Russian decoration.

The coffin was transported up the River Neva on a galley, with long black crape hanging overboard, trailing in the water. On 12 November 1728, Anna was laid to rest next to her parents in the still unfinished St Peter and St Paul Cathedral.

# Dost Mohammad of Bhopal

In his final years, which saw his humiliation at the hands of the Nizam, Khan's aggression had mellowed down considerably. He sought inspiration from Sufi mystics and saints, and veered towards spiritualism. He admonished his brother Aqil for desecrating a Buddhist statue in Sanchi. He encouraged several scholars, hakeems (doctors) and artists to settle in Bhopal. Several Pashtuns, including those of 
Yusufzai, Rohilla and Feroze clans, settled in Bhopal during his reign due to relatively peaceful environment of the area.

Dost Mohammad Khan died of an illness in March 1728. It is said that he had 30 wounds on his body from the various fights and battles he had participated in. He was buried in the Fatehgarh Fort beside his wife Fatah Bibi.

Dost Mohammad Khan was survived by 5 daughters and 6 sons (Yar, Sultan, Sadar, Fazil, Wasil and Khan Bahadur). He married several times, but only few of his wives have been chronicled. Four of his children were from his first wife Mehraj Bibi. Kunwar Sardar Bai (later Fatah Bibi), his favorite wife of Rajput descent, was childless, but had an adopted son called Ibrahmin Khan. Khan had three children from Jai Kunwar (later Taj Bibi), who had been presented to him by the zamindar (landowning chieftain) of Kaliakheri.

The court of Bhopal appointed Khan's younger son, Sultan Mohammad, as his successor. Sultan Mohammad Khan was 7 or 8-year-old at the time. The Nizam overruled the appointment, and sent the Dost's hostage teenage son Yar Mohammad Khan to Bhopal with a thousand horsemen. Yar Mohammad Khan was the eldest son of Dost, but he was not his first wife Mehraj Bibi's son; he could have been born of a consort soon after Dost came to Malwa. The court of Bhopal refused to grant him the title of Nawab on the grounds that he was an illegitimate son. Yar Mohammad was, however, allowed to execute the royal functions as the regent.

The Bhopal State later became a protectorate of the British India, and was ruled by the descendents of Dost Mohammad Khan till 1949, when it was merged into the newly independent Union of India.

# Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany

After his sojourn to Great Britain, Ernest Augustus returned to his previous life and continued to divide his time between Schloss Osnabrück and the court at Herrenhausen, while actively managing the affairs of both states. He died at Osnabrück on 14 August 1728 (NS) and was buried there. One year earlier his brother George I had also died there on a journey. 
Believed to be homosexual, Ernest Augustus never married. Upon his death, his British and Irish peerages became extinct.

# Crown Prince Hyojang

In 1735, seven years after his death, his half-brother Sado was born and succeeded Hyojang as Crown Prince. In 1762, Sado was imprisoned in a wooden rice chest by the orders of his father King Yeongjo, and died 8 days later, leaving his son Yi San as the royal successor. King Yeongjo was concerned that Yi San, being Sado's son and successor, would be branded with the title of "Son of a prisoner" or "Son of a psycho" and thus become ineligible to succeed the throne, so in February 21, 1764, the King decreed that Yi San would become the adoptive son of the long-dead Crown Prince Hyojang.

In 1776, King Yeongjo died of dementia and Yi San succeeded him as King Jeongjo. Surprisingly, on his coronation day, Jeongjo announced to his courtiers, "I am the son of Crown Prince Sado", In spite of this, King Jeongjo did not change the laws of King Yeonjo. Jeongjo later honored Prince Hyojang as an Honor King, and granted him the posthumous epithet title of Jinjong (진종 眞宗) and Great King of Onryangyemyongchulmun(온량예명철문대왕 眞宗溫良睿明哲文大王). Hyojang's wife Lady Cho Hyunbin of Pungyang was also honored as an honor Queen and given the posthumous epithet title of Honor Queen-consert Hyosun(효순왕후 孝純王后).

In July 31, 1907, Hyojang was appointed emperor by Sunjong of Joseon and given the posthumous title of Emperor So Jinjong(진종소황제 眞宗昭皇帝) of the Korean empires.

# Esther Johnson

Her health began to fail in her mid-forties. In 1726 she was thought to be dying; Swift rushed back from London to be with her but found her better. The following year it became clear that she was gravely ill. After sinking slowly for months she died on 28 January 1728, and was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Swift was inconsolable at Esther's death and wrote The Death of Mrs. Johnson in tribute to her; when he died he was buried beside her at his own request. A ward in St Patrick's University Hospital is named "Stella" in her memory.
