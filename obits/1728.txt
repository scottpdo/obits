# Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia

On 21 February 1728, Anna gave birth in Kiel Castle to a son named Carl Peter Ulrich, the future Peter III of Russia. Peter would go on to be the future Emperor of Russia and found the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov that would go on to rule Russia until the early 20th-century. A few days after his birth, the barely twenty-year-old duchess caught puerperal fever (postpartum infection) and died on 4 March 1728. In memory of his wife, Carl Friedrich founded the Order of St Anna, which subsequently became a Russian decoration.

Before her death, Anna Petrovna had asked to be buried alongside her father in St Petersburg. Two ships, the Raphael and the Cruiser, were dispatched to Kiel for Anna’s body. The coffin was transported up the River Neva on a galley, with long black crape hanging overboard, trailing in the water. On 12 November 1728, Anna was laid to rest next to her parents in the still unfinished St Peter and St Paul Cathedral.

He and his wife had four sons and two daughters.  He left the  house  at Lower Lypiatt and his estate at Tarlton to his son John, while he left his three manors and various other lands near Cirencester and Stroud to his grandson.

# Dost Mohammad of Bhopal

In his final years, which saw his humiliation at the hands of the Nizam, Khan's aggression had mellowed down considerably. He sought inspiration from Sufi mystics and saints, and veered towards spiritualism. He admonished his brother Aqil for desecrating a Buddhist statue in Sanchi. He encouraged several scholars, hakeems (doctors) and artists to settle in Bhopal. Several Pashtuns, including those of 
Yusufzai, Rohilla and Feroze clans, settled in Bhopal during his reign due to relatively peaceful environment of the area.

Dost Mohammad Khan died of an illness in March 1728. It is said that he had 30 wounds on his body from the various fights and battles he had participated in. He was buried in the Fatehgarh Fort beside his wife Fatah Bibi.

Dost Mohammad Khan was survived by 5 daughters and 6 sons (Yar, Sultan, Sadar, Fazil, Wasil and Khan Bahadur). He married several times, but only few of his wives have been chronicled. Four of his children were from his first wife Mehraj Bibi. Kunwar Sardar Bai (later Fatah Bibi), his favorite wife of Rajput descent, was childless, but had an adopted son called Ibrahmin Khan. Khan had three children from Jai Kunwar (later Taj Bibi), who had been presented to him by the zamindar (landowning chieftain) of Kaliakheri.

The court of Bhopal appointed Khan's younger son, Sultan Mohammad, as his successor. Sultan Mohammad Khan was 7 or 8-year-old at the time. The Nizam overruled the appointment, and sent the Dost's hostage teenage son Yar Mohammad Khan to Bhopal with a thousand horsemen. Yar Mohammad Khan was the eldest son of Dost, but he was not his first wife Mehraj Bibi's son; he could have been born of a consort soon after Dost came to Malwa. The court of Bhopal refused to grant him the title of Nawab on the grounds that he was an illegitimate son. Yar Mohammad was, however, allowed to execute the royal functions as the regent.

The Bhopal State later became a protectorate of the British India, and was ruled by the descendents of Dost Mohammad Khan till 1949, when it was merged into the newly independent Union of India.

# Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany

After his sojourn to Great Britain, Ernest Augustus returned to his previous life and continued to divide his time between Schloss Osnabrück and the court at Herrenhausen, while actively managing the affairs of both states. He died at Osnabrück on 14 August 1728 (NS) and was buried there. One year earlier his brother George I had also died there on a journey. 
Believed to be homosexual, Ernest Augustus never married. Upon his death, his British and Irish peerages became extinct.

# Crown Prince Hyojang

In 1735, seven years after his death, his half-brother Sado was born and succeeded Hyojang as Crown Prince. In 1762, Sado was imprisoned in a wooden rice chest by the orders of his father King Yeongjo, and died 8 days later, leaving his son Yi San as the royal successor. King Yeongjo was concerned that Yi San, being Sado's son and successor, would be branded with the title of "Son of a prisoner" or "Son of a psycho" and thus become ineligible to succeed the throne, so in February 21, 1764, the King decreed that Yi San would become the adoptive son of the long-dead Crown Prince Hyojang.

In 1776, King Yeongjo died of dementia and Yi San succeeded him as King Jeongjo. Surprisingly, on his coronation day, Jeongjo announced to his courtiers, "I am the son of Crown Prince Sado", In spite of this, King Jeongjo did not change the laws of King Yeonjo. Jeongjo later honored Prince Hyojang as an Honor King, and granted him the posthumous epithet title of Jinjong (진종 眞宗) and Great King of Onryangyemyongchulmun(온량예명철문대왕 眞宗溫良睿明哲文大王). Hyojang's wife Lady Cho Hyunbin of Pungyang was also honored as an honor Queen and given the posthumous epithet title of Honor Queen-consert Hyosun(효순왕후 孝純王后).

In July 31, 1907, Hyojang was appointed emperor by Sunjong of Joseon and given the posthumous title of Emperor So Jinjong(진종소황제 眞宗昭皇帝) of the Korean empires.

# Esther Johnson

Her health began to fail in her mid-forties. In 1726 she was thought to be dying; Swift rushed back from London to be with her but found her better. The following year it became clear that she was gravely ill. After sinking slowly for months she died on 28 January 1728, and was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Swift was inconsolable at Esther's death and wrote The Death of Mrs. Johnson in tribute to her; when he died he was buried beside her at his own request. A ward in St Patrick's University Hospital is named "Stella" in her memory.

# Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen

The only son and heir of Leopold succumbed to smallpox in August 1728, and the prince's second daughter, who also contracted the disease, died in early September. Soon  Leopold caught smallpox as well; on 17 November he played his violin for the last time and died two days later in Köthen, aged thirty-three.

With no surviving male heir, Leopold was succeeded by his brother Augustus Louis.

# Samuel Molyneux

Molyneux married Lady Elizabeth Capel, daughter of Algernon Capell, 2nd Earl of Essex, on 5 April 1717. In 1728, he suffered a fit while in the House of Commons.  He was treated by court anatomist Nathaniel St André, but the treatment did not prove successful, and Molyneux died in Kew in April.  On the night of the death, St André eloped with Molyneux's wife, Elizabeth, the two marrying in 1730.  Samuel Madden, a relative of Molyneux's, claimed that St André had poisoned the MP.  Although St André won an action for defamation, he found himself unable to secure regular work.

# Sir Nathaniel Napier, 3rd Baronet

Napier died at More Critchell on 24 February 1728. He and his second wife Catherine had five sons including William, Gerard and Wyndham and three daughters Diana, Catherine and Blanch. He was succeeded in the baronetcy successively by his sons William and Gerard. The baronetcy became extinct on the death of Gerard's son. The estates went to Humphrey Sturt son of Diana and her husband Humphrey Sturt.

# Serfoji I

Serfoji I died in 1728. One of his queens performed Sati. He was succeeded by his younger brother Tukkoji.

# Charles Lyon, 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne

On 9 May 1728 Mr Carnegie of Lour, residing in the burgh of Forfar, was burying his daughter. Before the funeral, he entertained the Earl of Strathmore, his own brother James Carnegie of Finhaven, Mr Lyon of Bridgeton, and some others, at dinner in his house. After the funeral, these gentlemen adjourned to a tavern, and drank a good deal. Carnegie of Finhaven got extremely drunk. Lyon of Bridgeton was not so intoxicated, but the drink made him "rude and unmannerly" towards Finhaven. 

Afterwards, the Earl of Strathmore went to call at the house of Mr Carnegie’s sister, Lady Auchterhouse, and the others followed. The presence of a lady (even a lady who was a widowed sister-in-law) failed to make Bridgeton conduct himself discreetly. He continued his "boisterous rudeness" towards Finhaven and even used some rudeness towards the lady herself.

About dusk, the party sallied forth into the street, and here Bridgeton pushed Carnegie of Finhaven into a "deep and dirty kennel" (ditch), which covered him nearly head to foot with "mire". Incensed by Bridgeton's action, Carnegie of Finhaven rose and, drawing his sword, ran up to Bridgeton with "deadly design". The earl, seeing him advance, pushed Bridgeton aside, and unhappily received the lunge full in the middle of his own body. The Earl died forty-nine hours after the incident.

Carnegie of Finhaven was tried for murder in a famous trial which established the "not guilty" verdict (in addition to "proven" and "not proven") in Scots Law and the right of Scots juries to try the whole case and not just the facts known as Jury Nullification.

# Rose Venerini

Rose Venerini died a saintly death in the community at the Basilica of San Marco in Rome on the evening of May 7, 1728. By then, she had opened more than 40 schools. Her remains were entombed in the nearby Jesuit Church of the Gesù, so loved by her. In 1952, on the occasion of her beatification, they were transferred to the chapel of the General Motherhouse in Rome.

The Sisters went to the United States in 1909, primarily to help the Italian immigrants to that country, establishing the first day care centers in many cities of the Northeastern United States. They served in Switzerland from 1971 to 1985 and the congregation has since extended its apostolic activity to other lands: India, Brazil, Cameroon, Romania, Albania, Chile, Venezuela and Nigeria.

Venerini was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 15, 2006.
