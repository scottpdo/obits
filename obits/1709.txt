# Albert Auwercx

Auwercx was buried in the church of Our Lady of the Chapel on 31 August 1709. His workshop continued to be maintained by his son Philippe (1663 - 1740).

# Robert Bolling

In 1681, after his first wife died, Col. Bolling married his second wife Anne Stith, daughter of John Drury and Jane (Gregory) Stith. They had the following nine children together.  Source needed to substantiate John Stith had a middle name (middle names very uncommon in the 17th century).  He worked with a Thomas Drury as a young man and somehow learned the law.  Perhaps Mr. Drury enabled Stith to study by access to his private legal book collection, Harvard being the only N. American college yet established in the 1660s and an English education being very unlikely for a former indentured servant such as Stith. This is the more probable origin of the Drury name in the Stith line. Also his wife Jane's maiden name was certainly not Gregory or Parsons as they were both previous husbands.  One court record lists her as "Jane R Stith" but this might be a phonetic spelling for Aldridge. She was illiterate- left her mark in the record, not a signature- and so may have believed her name began with "R."  There was, in fact, a Jane Aldridge listed in an early Charles City Co. record prior to her first known marriage to Mr. Gregory. No prior (prior to her marriage to Gregory) record of another Jane in the county with a last name beginning with "R." 



Jane Bolling (b. 1682), died young.
Robert Bolling Jr. (1682–1749), married Anne Mary Cocke. Robert was the grandfather of Beverley Randolph, the eighth Governor of Virginia.
Stith Bolling (1686–1727), married Elizabeth Hartwell.
Captain Edward Bolling (1687–1710), married Ms. Slaughter died of smallpox at sea.
Anne Bolling (1690–1750), married Robert Wynne.
Drury Bolling (1695–1726), married Elizabeth Meriwether.
Thomas Bolling (1697–1734).
Agnes Bolling (1700–1762), married Richard Kennon.
Molly Mary Bolling (b. 1702), married Andrew Baker.


The descendants of Robert Bolling's first marriage are sometimes referred to in family history forums as "Red Bollings" due to the Native American lineage of Jane Rolfe's grandmother Pocahontas. These "Red Bollings" include prominent descendants such as Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Bolling's great-grandson, Robert Bolling, was one of the most prolific poets in colonial Virginia. The descendants of his second marriage are referred to as "White Bollings".

As a merchant and planter, Bolling acquired a large estate. He was colonel of the militia and was a member of the House of Burgesses from Charles City County in 1702.

Robert Bolling died on July 17, 1709, and was buried on his plantation Kippax, in Prince George Co., Virginia, where his tomb still stands. However, in 1858, his remains were removed from Kippax to the Bolling mausoleum at Blandford Cemetery in Petersburg, Virginia erected by his great grandson.

# Edmund Boulter

“Mr. Boulter, a grocer of the citty, and executor of the late Sir John Cutler, is dead, worth 150,000 L. [i.e. £150,000], 'tis said, and has left 2000 L. per ann. to Mr. Boulter, a relation of him in Yorkshire, and 2000 L. per ann. more to his nephew, Mr. Fryor,[note 1] a pewterer in Gracechurch street.”

Edmund Boulter died 15 February 1708/1709 and was buried nine days later in the south chancel of St Christopher le Stocks, Threadneedle Street, London.

Aside from the reverted properties of Wimpole, Gawthorpe and Harewood, where Sir John Cutler had lived for a time in the castle, Boulter owned Little Haseley Oxfordshire, estates in Lincolnshire, the manor of Deptford near London, and estates in Hampshire Wherwell and Goodworth Clatford acquired in 1695 from Lord de la Warr, property in Kent and London and in Somerset.

# Jean-Baptiste Boyer d’Éguilles

He died in Aix-en-Provence, at the age of fifty-eight.

# Dimitry of Rostov

Upon Dimitry's death on October 28, 1709 his relics were placed at St. Jacob's Monastery, which his followers would rebuild as Dimitry's shrine. A fortress on the Don River was named after him; today it is known as Rostov-on-the-Don.

# Robert Giguère

Indications are that Robert Giguère was a well-respected member of the community: he had donated some land for the Basilica in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Quebec and diligently functioned as head vestryman for some time. He is regarded as a founder of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Quebec.

No death certificate was recorded for Robert Giguère, or perhaps it was lost. However, most historians agree that he died in August 1709, at the age of 93 years and 5 months. His wife, Aymée Miville followed him in death three years later, on December 10, 1712.

Robert and Aymée had 13 children, seven girls and six boys:



Marie-Charlotte (1653–????)
Martin (1655–????)
Jeanne (1657–1673)
Marie (1659–1710)
Jean-Baptiste (1660–1750)
Robert (1663–1711)
Pierre (1665–????)
Marie-Anne (1668–1762)
Étienne (1670–1749)
Ange (1671–????)
Joseph (1673–1741)
Marie-Agnès (1675–1760)
Marguerite (1678–1723)


Five of his children were married, but only four had children. Of the boys, Joseph, Martin and Jean-Baptiste had children. Joseph and Jean-Baptiste remained in Quebec. Joseph lived out his life in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Quebec, his descendants would later move across from Quebec City to the beautiful Île d'Orléans. Jean-Baptiste settled in what is now Laprarie, Quebec and his descendants mostly come from Montreal. Martin, ultimately became the ancestor to most all Americans who call themselves Giguère, or any the many variations of the name.

Today there are no direct descendants of Robert Giguère in Tourouvre. One of the few signs that they had been there is a spot known as La Giguerie.

They may have disappeared from Le Perche, but thanks to Robert, thousands of people, including the famous hockey player, Jean-Sébastien Giguère, who call themselves Giguère or one of its many variants, can be found all over North America.

# Edward Lhuyd

During his travels, Lhuyd developed asthma, which eventually led to his death from pleurisy in Oxford in 1709.

The Snowdon lily (Gagea serotina) was for a time called Lloydia serotina after Lhuyd.[citation needed] Cymdeithas Edward Llwyd, the National Naturalists' Society of Wales, is named after him. On 9 June 2001, a bronze bust of Lhuyd was unveiled by Dafydd Wigley, the former leader of Plaid Cymru, outside the University of Wales's Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies in Aberystwyth, adjacent to the National Library of Wales. The sculptor was John Meirion Morris; the plinth, carved by Ieuan Rees, reads EDWARD / LHUYD / 1660–1709 / IEITHYDD / HYNAFIAETHYDD / NATURIAETHWR ("linguist, antiquary, naturalist").

# Sir Edward Littleton, 2nd Baronet

Littleton's son and heir, Edward, a horseracing enthusiast but an unenthusiastic MP like his father, died in 1706, predeceasing his father, after a notable career as an administrator in India. However, this Edward had a son, also Edward. This grandson of the baronet was thus destined to become Sir Edward Littleton, 3rd Baronet.

The 2nd Baronet died in 1709 and was buried at Tamworth on 31 July.
