# Henry Hyde, Viscount Cornbury

Cornbury died unmarried in Paris on 26 April 1753, predeceasing his father by six months; accounts differ on whether he died from a fall from a horse or by his own hand.

Croft died on 10 December 1753, having had three sons and a daughter. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Archer Croft.

# Umabai Dabhade

After their arrest and Gaekwad's subsequent alliance with the Peshwa, the Dabhades lost their power and much of their wealth. Umabai died on 28 November 1753 at Nadgemodi in Pune. Her samadhi (tomb) is situated at the "Shrimant Sarsenapati Dabhade Shri Baneshwar Mandir" in Talegaon Dabhade.

# Nicolas Fatio de Duillier

Fatio was in Switzerland in 1699, 1700, and 1701.  In Duillier he was reconciled to his father and collaborated with his brother Jean-Christopher in surveying the mountains around Lac Léman.  He also undertook a deep study of the prophetic books in the Bible.  Back in London, Fatio worked as a mathematical tutor in Spitalfields.  In 1706 he began to associate with the Camisards, a radical group of Huguenot exiles who had fled from France during the Wars of Religion in that country.  The group with which Fatio became affiliated was known as the "French prophets" and preached impending destruction and judgment.



  Title and illustration of an anonymous handbill printed in London in 1707.  The picture shows Élie Marion, Jean Daudé, and Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, leaders of the so-called French prophets, standing on the scaffold at Charing Cross after being sentenced to the pillory for sedition.

The British government suspected the millenarian French prophets of contriving a political scheme, and in 1707 Élie Marion, Jean Daudé, and Fatio were tried before the Queen's Bench on charges brought against them by the mainstream Huguenot churches in England. The three were convicted of sedition and sentenced to the pillory. On 2 December, Fatio stood on a scaffold at Charing Cross with an inscription on his hat that read 
Nicolas Fatio convicted for abetting and favouring Elias Marion, in the Wicked and counterfeit prophecies, and causing them to be printed and published, to terrify the Queen's people.

 By the influence of the Duke of Ormonde, to whose brother, Lord Arran, Fatio had been tutor, he was protected from the violence of the mob.

Fatio was among those who believed in the prophecy that Thomas Emes would be raised from the dead, attracting ridicule and condemnation even from his own brother.  In 1711 Fatio travelled to Berlin, Halle, and Vienna as a missionary of the French prophets.  A second mission in 1712–13 took him to Stockholm, Prussia, Halle, Constantinople, Smyrna, and Rome.  Fatio then moved to Holland, where he composed written accounts of his missions and of the prophecies delivered during them.  Some of these accounts, in French and Latin, were published in 1714.

Back in London, Fatio once again communicated with the Royal Society, of which his old friend Sir Isaac Newton had been president since 1704.  In 1717 Fatio presented a series of papers on the precession of the equinoxes and climate change, subjects that he regarded from both a scientific and a millenarian perspective.  In the spring of that same year he moved to Worcester, where he formed some congenial friendships and busied himself with scientific pursuits, alchemy, and study of the cabbala.  Fatio would spend the rest of his life in Worcester and nearby Madresfield.

In 1732, through the influence of John Conduitt, Newton's nephew-in-law, Fatio endeavoured unsuccessfully to obtain a reward for having saved the Prince of Orange from Count Fenil's kidnapping plot.  He also assisted Conduitt in designing Newton's funerary monument in Westminster Abbey and in writing the inscription for it.  Fatio died, on 28 April or 12 May 1753, in Madresfield and was buried at the church of St. Nicholas, Worcester. His compatriot Georges-Louis Le Sage later purchased many of his scientific papers which, together with those of Le Sage, are now in the Geneva Library.

# Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff

In 1753 Knobelsdorff's long-time liver disease became more troublesome. A journey to the Belgian therapeutic baths at Spa brought no relief. On September 7, 1753, only a short while before his death, Knobelsdorff wrote to the king, "when the pain briefly stopped". He thanked him "for all the kindness and all the benefits Your Majesty has showered on me during my lifetime". At the same time he requested that his two daughters be recognized as his legal heirs. That was problematic because the girls came from a liaison not befitting his social class. The long-time bachelor Knobelsdorff had entered into a relationship with the "middle class" daughter of the Charlottenburg sacristan, Schöne, in 1746, thereby earning the disapproval of court society. Frederick II agreed to his request, however with the restriction that his title of nobility not be bequeathed.

Knobelsdorff died on September 16, 1753. Two days later the Berlinische Nachrichten reported, "On the 16th of this month the honorable gentleman, Mr. George Wentzel, Baron of Knobelsdorff, artistic director of all royal palaces, houses and gardens, director-in-chief of all construction in all provinces, as well as finance, war and domain councillor, departed this life after a prolonged illness in the 53rd year of his renowned existence." On September 18 he was buried in the vault of the German Church on Gendarmenmarkt. Four years later his friend Antoine Pesne was buried next to him. When the church was rebuilt in 1881 these mortal remains were transferred to one of the cemeteries at Hallisches Tor; his grave was marked with a marble slab and a putto. This gravesite was destroyed by a bomb in World War II. Today a simple white marble memorial on an honorary grave of the State of Berlin in Cemetery No. 1 of the Jerusalem and New Church congregation brings to mind Knobelsdorff and Pesne.

# Henry Lascelles (1690–1753)

Henry retired from the business in 1750, at age 60, but retained his seat in Parliament, along with much of his influence. In his will, he divided most assets among his two eldest sons, with Edwin receiving land and its associated buildings, and Daniel the business interests.

Extensive business correspondence from the Lascelles and Maxwell firm has survived, and is the basis of modern research work by writer Adam Nicolson.

Henry Lascelles committed suicide in 1753 by slashing his arm's veins. He was suffering from cataracts in his eyes. At this juncture, he was reckoned to be the wealthiest person in England, by writer Adam Nicolson, with a personal fortune estimated at some half-million pounds.
