# Henry Hyde, Viscount Cornbury

Cornbury died unmarried in Paris on 26 April 1753, predeceasing his father by six months; accounts differ on whether he died from a fall from a horse or by his own hand.

# Sir Archer Croft, 2nd Baronet

Croft died on 10 December 1753, having had three sons and a daughter. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Archer Croft.

# Joseph da Costa

Da Costa died in 1753.

# Umabai Dabhade

After their arrest and Gaekwad's subsequent alliance with the Peshwa, the Dabhades lost their power and much of their wealth. Umabai died on 28 November 1753 at Nadgemodi in Pune. Her samadhi (tomb) is situated at the "Shrimant Sarsenapati Dabhade Shri Baneshwar Mandir" in Talegaon Dabhade.

# Nicolas Fatio de Duillier

Fatio was in Switzerland in 1699, 1700, and 1701.  In Duillier he was reconciled to his father and collaborated with his brother Jean-Christopher in surveying the mountains around Lac Léman.  He also undertook a deep study of the prophetic books in the Bible.  Back in London, Fatio worked as a mathematical tutor in Spitalfields.  In 1706 he began to associate with the Camisards, a radical group of Huguenot exiles who had fled from France during the Wars of Religion in that country.  The group with which Fatio became affiliated was known as the "French prophets" and preached impending destruction and judgment.


The British government suspected the millenarian French prophets of contriving a political scheme, and in 1707 Élie Marion, Jean Daudé, and Fatio were tried before the Queen's Bench on charges brought against them by the mainstream Huguenot churches in England. The three were convicted of sedition and sentenced to the pillory. On 2 December, Fatio stood on a scaffold at Charing Cross with an inscription on his hat that read 
 By the influence of the Duke of Ormonde, to whose brother, Lord Arran, Fatio had been tutor, he was protected from the violence of the mob.

Fatio was among those who believed in the prophecy that Thomas Emes would be raised from the dead, attracting ridicule and condemnation even from his own brother.  In 1711 Fatio travelled to Berlin, Halle, and Vienna as a missionary of the French prophets.  A second mission in 1712–13 took him to Stockholm, Prussia, Halle, Constantinople, Smyrna, and Rome.  Fatio then moved to Holland, where he composed written accounts of his missions and of the prophecies delivered during them.  Some of these accounts, in French and Latin, were published in 1714.

Back in London, Fatio once again communicated with the Royal Society, of which his old friend Sir Isaac Newton had been president since 1704.  In 1717 Fatio presented a series of papers on the precession of the equinoxes and climate change, subjects that he regarded from both a scientific and a millenarian perspective.  In the spring of that same year he moved to Worcester, where he formed some congenial friendships and busied himself with scientific pursuits, alchemy, and study of the cabbala.  Fatio would spend the rest of his life in Worcester and nearby Madresfield.

In 1732, through the influence of John Conduitt, Newton's nephew-in-law, Fatio endeavoured unsuccessfully to obtain a reward for having saved the Prince of Orange from Count Fenil's kidnapping plot.  He also assisted Conduitt in designing Newton's funerary monument in Westminster Abbey and in writing the inscription for it.  Fatio died, on 28 April or 12 May 1753, in Madresfield and was buried at the church of St. Nicholas, Worcester. His compatriot Georges-Louis Le Sage later purchased many of his scientific papers which, together with those of Le Sage, are now in the Geneva Library.

# Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff

In 1753 Knobelsdorff's long-time liver disease became more troublesome. A journey to the Belgian therapeutic baths at Spa brought no relief. On September 7, 1753, only a short while before his death, Knobelsdorff wrote to the king, "when the pain briefly stopped". He thanked him "for all the kindness and all the benefits Your Majesty has showered on me during my lifetime". At the same time he requested that his two daughters be recognized as his legal heirs. That was problematic because the girls came from a liaison not befitting his social class. The long-time bachelor Knobelsdorff had entered into a relationship with the "middle class" daughter of the Charlottenburg sacristan, Schöne, in 1746, thereby earning the disapproval of court society. Frederick II agreed to his request, however with the restriction that his title of nobility not be bequeathed.

Knobelsdorff died on September 16, 1753. Two days later the Berlinische Nachrichten reported, "On the 16th of this month the honorable gentleman, Mr. George Wentzel, Baron of Knobelsdorff, artistic director of all royal palaces, houses and gardens, director-in-chief of all construction in all provinces, as well as finance, war and domain councillor, departed this life after a prolonged illness in the 53rd year of his renowned existence." On September 18 he was buried in the vault of the German Church on Gendarmenmarkt. Four years later his friend Antoine Pesne was buried next to him. When the church was rebuilt in 1881 these mortal remains were transferred to one of the cemeteries at Hallisches Tor; his grave was marked with a marble slab and a putto. This gravesite was destroyed by a bomb in World War II. Today a simple white marble memorial on an honorary grave of the State of Berlin in Cemetery No. 1 of the Jerusalem and New Church congregation brings to mind Knobelsdorff and Pesne.

# Henry Lascelles (1690–1753)

Henry retired from the business in 1750, at age 60, but retained his seat in Parliament, along with much of his influence. In his will, he divided most assets among his two eldest sons, with Edwin receiving land and its associated buildings, and Daniel the business interests.

Extensive business correspondence from the Lascelles and Maxwell firm has survived, and is the basis of modern research work by writer Adam Nicolson.

Henry Lascelles committed suicide in 1753 by slashing his arm's veins. He was suffering from cataracts in his eyes. At this juncture, he was reckoned to be the wealthiest person in England, by writer Adam Nicolson, with a personal fortune estimated at some half-million pounds.

# Maria Elisabetta Carlotta of Savoy

Maria Elisabetta died on 17 April 1753, in Turin, with only 9 months. She was buried in the Basilica of Superga, traditional burial site of the House of Savoy.

# Nawab Kapur Singh

Nawab Kapur Singh requested the community to relieve him of his office, due to his old age, and at his suggestion, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia was chosen as the supreme commander of the Dal Khalsa. Kapur Singh died in 9 October 1753 at Amritsar and was succeeded by his nephew (Dhan Singh's son), Khushal Singh.

Khushal Singh who succeeded him as the leader of the misl. Sardar Khushal Singh played a significant role in expanding the territories of the Singhpuria Misl on both the banks of the  Satluj river. The most important of the possessions of Khushal Singh were Patti, Bhartgarh, Nurpur, Bahrampur and Jalandhar. Khushal Singh also occupied Ludhiana. He had to divide the district of Banur with Patiala. He died in 1795 leaving his misl stronger than ever it was and with territorial possessions far larger than those he had inherited.

Khushal Singh was succeeded by his son Budh Singh. When Abdali returned home after his ninth invasion of India, the Sikhs had occupied more territories in the Punjab. Sheikh Nizam-ud-din was the ruler of Jalandhar at that time. Sardar Budh Singh defeated Nizam-id-din on the battle-field and occupied Jalandhar. He also took possession of Bulandgarh, Behrampur, Nurpur and Haibatpur-Patti. This victory brought him yearly revenue of three lakhs of rupees.

However, Budh Singh could not equal Khushal Singh's talents. The Singhpuria Misl began to decline and ultimately all its possessions on the west of Satluj were annexed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. On his possessions on the east of the Satluj, however, the British extended their protection to him. 
Budh Singh died in 1816, leaving seven sons behind him. His eldest son, Amar Singh, retained possession of Bhartgarh and divided the rest of the territories among his six brothers as under:-

The descendants of these Sardars still live on their respective estates.

# Balthasar Neumann

He died in Würzburg on 19 August 1753 and is buried at the Marienkapelle there.

The final German 50 DM note showed a picture of him together with the famous staircase located in the Residence of Würzburg. Neumann was also depicted by Tiepolo in the ceiling fresco above the stairway of the Residence, in pseudo-military uniform, leaning over a cannon. He had boasted that the ceiling was so well constructed that not even the roar of a cannon would make the roof fall.

# Sir Danvers Osborn, 3rd Baronet

On 12 October 1753, Osborn's dead body was found in the garden of the house in which he was lodged, which  belonged to a local councilman. The body presented evidences of strangulation. James De Lancey, the lieutenant governor who took over as acting governor on Osborn's death, reported to the Board of Trade that Osborn had had a melancholic demeanor, which evidenced a great psychological disorder. Historically, such depression to provoke Osborn's suicide, is attributed to grief over his lost wife. The New York Post reported his death and gave details of the last week of his life before his suicide.

Initially, Osborn was buried at the Trinity Church of New York. In 1754, his remains were transported to Osborn's native parish of England (Chicksands), where he was reinterred.

# Sir Arthur Owen, 3rd Baronet

Owen died on 6 June 1753, and was buried at Monkton, Pembrokeshire. He and his wife had six sons and six daughters. He was succeeded by his son William who was also an MP.  Another son John was also an MP.

# Hans Sloane


In his final year, Sir Hans Sloane suffered from a disorder with some paralysis. He died on the afternoon of 11 January 1753 at the Manor House, Chelsea, and was buried on 18 January in the south-east corner of the churchyard at Chelsea Old Church with the following memorial:

# William Stephens (Georgia)

At almost 80 years old, Stephens was forced to retire in 1750 by his age, his colleagues and his health. The Trustees turned Georgia affairs over to Henry Parker, although Stephens technically continued to hold the post of president until April 1751. To satisfy the role of secretary, the Trustees chose James Habersham. With his son, Newdigate, Stephens moved out to his plantation at Beaulieu (or Bewlie, as Stephens referred to it, after Beaulieu in Hampshire) in mid-1750 and disappeared from public life. Less than three years later, he died of the illnesses associated with old age, apparently in 1753, although the details of death recorded by his son (including the date and descriptions of Stephens' condition) are, according to his biographer Julie Anne Sweet, somewhat fanciful.

History has shamefully forgotten the significance and achievements of William Stephens, one of the leaders of early Georgia.
