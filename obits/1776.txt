Edward Bentham (1707-1776): publications (not a complete list)
Reflections upon the Nature and Usefulness of Logick (1740)
Introduction to Moral Philosophy (1745) 
Letter to a Young Gentleman of Oxford (1749)

Reflections on the Study of Divinity (1771)

During his lifetime Bentham was noted as an early riser who had often completed half a day's work before many others had begun their day. He enjoyed good health, but during his final years suffered a sporadic weakness in his eyes, attributed to "too free an use of them when he was young".   He was incapacitated by his final illness from 23 July 1776, but battled on with his studies "like a faithful soldier, in the exercise of his religion", dying at the start of the next month.

# Countess Palatine Francisca Christina of Sulzbach

  Canopy over the coffin of the Abbess


During the last years of her life, Francisca Christina was weak and frail and also plagued by diseases.  However, she was not an easy patient: a report from 1775 complains that she did not regularly take her medications, ... although we three medical man, Leidenfrost, Bruning and Tuttman, adopt every possibility to provide her with tasty, and yet effective [Medicine].  The octogenarian abbess died on 16 July 1776 in Essen, shortly before her fifty-year jubilee.  Her body was laid out in the audience hall of the abbey building under a magnificent canopy.  On 18 July the coffin was transferred from Essen to Steele, which was still independent, on a hearse drawn by six horses covered in black.  According to her last wishes, the princess was buried in the chapel of the orphanage she founded.
