# Edward Bentham

During his lifetime Bentham was noted as an early riser who had often completed half a day's work before many others had begun their day. He enjoyed good health, but during his final years suffered a sporadic weakness in his eyes, attributed to "too free an use of them when he was young".   He was incapacitated by his final illness from 23 July 1776, but battled on with his studies "like a faithful soldier, in the exercise of his religion", dying at the start of the next month.

# Victor-Thérèse Charpentier

Victor-Therese Charpentier died on December 31, 1776 in Port-au-Prince, during the Uprisings.

# Countess Palatine Francisca Christina of Sulzbach

During the last years of her life, Francisca Christina was weak and frail and also plagued by diseases.  However, she was not an easy patient: a report from 1775 complains that she did not regularly take her medications, ... although we three medical man, Leidenfrost, Bruning and Tuttman, adopt every possibility to provide her with tasty, and yet effective [Medicine].  The octogenarian abbess died on 16 July 1776 in Essen, shortly before her fifty-year jubilee.  Her body was laid out in the audience hall of the abbey building under a magnificent canopy.  On 18 July the coffin was transferred from Essen to Steele, which was still independent, on a hearse drawn by six horses covered in black.  According to her last wishes, the princess was buried in the chapel of the orphanage she founded.

# John Harrison

Harrison died on March 24, 1776 at the age of eighty-two, just shy of his eighty-third birthday. He was buried in the graveyard of St John's Church, Hampstead, in north London, along with his second wife Elizabeth and later their son William. His tomb was restored in 1879 by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, even though Harrison had never been a member of the Company.

Harrison's last home was 12, Red Lion Square, in the Holborn district of  London. There is a plaque dedicated to Harrison on the wall of Summit House, a 1925 modernist office block,  on the south side of the square. A memorial tablet to Harrison was unveiled in Westminster Abbey on 24 March 2006, finally recognising him as a worthy companion to his friend George Graham and Thomas Tompion, 'The Father of English Watchmaking', who are both buried in the Abbey. The memorial shows a meridian line (line of constant longitude) in two metals to highlight Harrison's most widespread invention, the bimetallic strip thermometer. The strip is engraved with its own longitude of 0 degrees, 7 minutes and 35 seconds West.

The Corpus Clock in Cambridge, unveiled in 2008, is a homage by the designer to Harrison's work but is of an electromechanical design. In appearance it features Harrison's grasshopper escapement, the 'pallet frame' being sculpted to resemble an actual grasshopper. This is the clock's defining feature. 

In 2014, Northern Rail renamed its train that runs between Barton and Cleethorpes as the John 'Longitude' Harrison.

On 3 April 2018, Google celebrated his 325th birthday by making a Google Doodle for its homepage.

# Robert Hay Drummond

In 1766, he lost his eldest daughter at the age of 16, and in 1773, his wife died. He never recovered this last blow, and died at Bishopthorpe on 10 December 1776. By his own desire he was buried under the altar of the parish church, with as little pomp as possible. Of his five sons the eldest, Robert Auriol, succeeded his uncle, Thomas Hay, as 10th earl of Kinnoull, 1787. A portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was engraved by Watson. A small medallion portrait is prefixed to his sermons.

# Jacob Hite

Though the feud between Hite and Stephen was extremely bitter, it was never resolved. Stephen headed off to fight in the American Revolutionary War and shortly after the printing of Stephen's rebuttal of Hite's accusations, Hite was killed by a band of Cherokee Indians upon returning to his new home in South Carolina.

Dateline, Williamsburg, Aug 30, 1776, passing along news from Mr. William Harrison, that "Captain John Hingston, with a number of settlers, arrived at Licking creed, near the Kentucky...Mr. Harrison likewise informs, that Mr. Jacob Hite, who lately removed from Berkeley county to the neighbourhood of the Cherokee country, with his family and a large parcel of negroes, were murdered at his own house by those savages, with most of his slaves, and his wife and children carried off prisoners; his son, who was in the Cherokee country, was likewise murdered. The Shawnee, Delawares, and Mingoes, had not met our commissioners, although two expresses had been sent to them for that purpose...".

# Jeanne Julie Éléonore de Lespinasse

By early 1776, Mlle de Lespinasse was in a state of mental and physical collapse, apparently caused by the misery of her relationship with Guibert. She had earlier shown depressive tendencies and a consequent dependence on opium may have aggravated her breakdown. On her deathbed, she refused to receive Guibert and instead, was watched over by her friend d'Alembert. She died on 22 May 1776 in Paris at the age of 43, possibly of tuberculosis. Her last words are said to have been "Am I still alive?"[citation needed]

# Pierre Abraham Lorillard

Lorillard died in 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, killed by Hessian mercenaries of the British during the British occupation of New York City. After his death, his business was carried on by his descendants and grew into the Lorillard Tobacco Company. In 1960, the company issued a Bicentennial Report, in which it was able to boast proudly that "P. Lorillard Company is older than the United States, taking its origin in the Colonial days of 1760 when British kings ruled the land... Lorillard is the oldest tobacco company in the world".  After Lorillard's death, his widow married a man named either John Holsman or Daniel Holtzman.

# Marie Durand

Marie Durand was released on 14 April 1768; she returned to her childhood home. Charles Tyler relates:

# Thomas More Molyneux

Molyneux died unmarried on 3 October 1776. A clergyman wrote of him that he was one of the few original men in the world with the comment “Politeness has the good effect of hiding what is offensive in us, but it covers at the same time many entertaining oddities, and he had more of them than any of our neighbours.”  The Loseley estate passed to his sisters Cassandra and Jane who also died childless. The estate then passed to his illegitimate son, James.

# Natalia Alexeievna (Wilhelmina Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt)

Natalia finally delivered a stillborn son, after a long and painful labour, on 15 April 1776. The infant was enormous and although it was impossible for Natalia to safely deliver the child, the court doctors did not perform a Caesarian. Shortly after the delivery, Natalia died. Her husband, Paul, was mad with grief and insisted on keeping her with him.

# John Quicke (1724–1776)

John Quicke was buried on 7 June 1776 at Newton St Cyres, in which church survives his mural monument, comprising coloured marbles and an urn. The inscription on the monument was transcribed by Rev. John Swete (died 1821), as follows:

# Sonom

In January 1776 his forces were defeated in the Jinchuan wars of the Ten Great Campaigns. He and his family were presented to the Emperor of China.

Circa June 13–14, 1776, Sonom and other rebel leaders were executed by lingchi. Of his family, some of the women were enslaved and given to lords of the Ölöd Mongol and Solun. Other women and the children were sentenced to life imprisonment (永遠監禁; 永远监禁; Yǒngyuǎn jiānjìn; Yung-yüan Chien-chin).

# Andrew Sprowle

Sprowle attempted to flee the Commonwealth of Virginia on May 25, 1776, after it fell to the Continental Army, but was unsuccessful.  Following Dunmore's retreat from Portsmouth in May 1776, Sprowle was exiled along with other Royalists to Gwynn's Island (now Mathews County, Virginia), where he died five days thereafter and was buried in an unmarked grave.

# William Stark (loyalist)

Stark died from injuries he received in falling from his horse on Long Island, New York during the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776.

# Yeongjo of Joseon

Fourteen years after Crown Prince Sado's death, Sado's son, Yeongjo's grandson Jeongjo, became king. The early part of the new King's years were marked by political intrigues and fear of court officials who were afraid that Jeongjo would seek revenge on them for petitioning the punishment that caused the death of his father, Crown Prince Sado.

Yeongjo was buried in the dynastic tombs at Donggureung. Yeongjo is buried with his second wife in the royal tomb of Wonneung (원릉, 元陵) in the city of Guri.

# Sir William Yorke, 1st Baronet

He died at Brentford in 1776: Elrington Ball has an interesting reference to the cause of death as "accidental poisoning". A contemporary newspaper report  describes the poisoning  as   being the result of an unfortunate mistake by his servant:  Yorke, who was suffering agonies  from  a kidney stone,  had been prescribed laudanum  to alleviate the pain. Although the servant had been instructed by the apothecary   as to  the proper dosage, on the day in question   he evidently forgot his instructions,  and simply handed the full  bottle of laudanum  to Yorke, who  was in such pain from his  stone  that he drank it all at one sitting. He  died  an hour later from the effects of the overdose.
