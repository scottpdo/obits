# John Barnard (British politician)

Barnard left Parliament at the 1761 general election, and died in 1764.

He is commemorated in an ornate bust displayed in the Temple of British Worthies at Lord Cobham's country house at Stowe, alongside similar statuesof Elizabeth I and Sir Francis Drake.

# William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath

An occasional pamphlet and an infrequent speech were afterwards the sole fruits of Bath's talents. His praises whilst in retirement have been sung by two bishops, Zachary Pearce and Thomas Newton. He was buried on 17 July 1764, in his own vault in Islip chapel, Westminster Abbey. The monument erected is by the sculptor Joseph Wilton.

He married on 27 December 1714 Anna Maria, daughter and co-heiress of John Gumley of Isleworth, commissary general to the army who was often satirized by the wits of the day (Notes and Queries, 3rd S. iI. 40 2-403, ~ 490). She died on 14 September 1758, and their only son William Pulteney died unmarried at Madrid on 12 February 1763. Pulteney's vast fortune passed in 1767 to Frances, wife of William Johnstone and daughter and co-heiress of his cousin, Daniel Pulteney, a bitter antagonist of Walpole in parliament, and had taken the name of Pulteney.

Of business he was never fond, and the loss in 1734 of his trusted friend John Merrill, who had supplied the qualities which he lacked, was lamented by him in a letter to Jonathan Swift. His chief weakness was a passion for money.

The town of Poultney, Vermont and the Poultney River were named for him.

# Peter van Bleeck

Van Bleeck died in July 1764 and was buried in London's Old St. Pancras Churchyard on 30 July 1764. A survey of 1795 states the grave is against the outer north wall of the original church. His Epitaph, as transcribed on page 43 in the 1869 book by Frederick Teague Cansick  reads:
Here Lies the Remains of Peter Van Bleeck Esq., worthy son of Richard van Bleeck Esq., A Gentleman of distinguished merit in every light, whether of husband, friend, citizen or Christian. Having married in 1746 (sic)  Alicia, youngest daughter of William Corry Esq., of Walpole in Norfolk, whom he left without issue, he died on the 21st July 1764 age 67.

# Charles Churchill (satirist)

In October 1764 he went to Boulogne to join Wilkes. There he was attacked by a fever of which he died on 4 November. He left his property to his two sons, and made Wilkes his literary executor with full powers. Wilkes did little. He wrote an epitaph for his friend and about half a dozen notes on his poems, and Andrew Kippis acknowledges some slight assistance from him in preparing his life of Churchill for the Biographia (1780). There is more than one instance of Churchill's generosity to his friends. In 1763 he found his friend Robert Lloyd in prison for debt. He paid a guinea a week for his better maintenance in the Fleet, and raised a subscription to set him free. Lloyd fell ill on receipt of the news of Churchill's death, and died shortly afterwards. Churchill's sister Patty, who was engaged to Lloyd, did not long survive them. William Cowper was his schoolfellow, and left many kindly references to him.

A partial collection of Churchill's poems appeared in 1763.

# William Eyre (lieutenant-colonel)

Eyre drowned off the English coast in November 1764 on his way home.

# Nicolas Ferry

Ferry's health declined in his late teens.  He developed a hunchback and had difficulty walking, and he suffered wasting of the soft tissues and signs of premature aging.  Eventually he became incontinent and a chronic invalid, and died on 8 June 1764 aged 22.  His skeleton was prepared and mounted for study, and is currently kept at the Musée de l'Homme in Paris. The rest of his remains were buried in the church at Lunéville; when the church was destroyed during the French Revolution, Ferry's inscribed mausoleum was preserved and is now at the Chateau de Lunéville.  Some of Ferry's outfits are preserved in the historical museum at Nancy and there are a number of wax statues of him still in existence.  A unique Luneville Faience statue of Ferry, 22 inches (56 cm) tall, modelled from life, was kept at the Chateau de Lunéville, but was destroyed in a fire in 2003.

In 2006 and 2008, French researchers published detailed studies of Ferry's skeletal remains, with particular attention to his jaws and facial bones.  They concluded that Ferry suffered from a rare genetic form of primordial dwarfism characterised by small, abnormal teeth without roots, and dubbed the condition NMOSR.

# John Garth

Garth died on 24 December 1764 and was buried in St Mary's Churchyard, Devizes on 2 January 1765. One monument of St. Mary's commemorates John Garth himself and in the chancel there are monuments to the memory of his widow and children. Their children were:



George Garth (about 1733–1819) British General in American Revolutionary War, Colonel of the 17th Regiment of Foot

Elizabeth (1739–1790)
Frances (1743- 1768)
