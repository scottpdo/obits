# Keki Abdi Pasha

After gathering troops for the war with Russia, he traveled to Aleppo that same month (March) and died there in April.

# Abdul Hamid I

Abdul Hamid died on 7 April 1789, at the age of sixty-four, in Constantinople. He was buried in Bahcekapi, a tomb he had built for himself.

He bred Arabian horses with great passion. One breed of Küheylan Arabians was named "Küheylan Abdülhamid" after him.

# Ethan Allen

On February 11, 1789, Allen traveled to South Hero, Vermont with one of his workers to visit his cousin, Ebenezer Allen, and to collect a load of hay. After an evening spent with friends and acquaintances, he spent the night there and set out the next morning for home. While accounts of the return journey are not entirely consistent, Allen apparently suffered an apoplectic fit en route and was unconscious by the time they returned home. Allen died at home several hours later, without ever regaining consciousness. He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery in Burlington. The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government and by large numbers of common folk who turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion.

Allen's death made nationwide headlines. The Bennington Gazette wrote of the local hero, "the patriotism and strong attachment which ever appeared uniform in the breast of this Great Man, was worth of his exalted character; the public have to lament the loss of a man who has rendered them great service". Although most obituaries were positive, a number of clergymen expressed different sentiments. "Allen was an ignorant and profane Deist, who died with a mind replete with horror and despair" was the opinion of Newark, New Jersey's Reverend Uzal Ogden. Yale's Timothy Dwight expressed satisfaction that the world no longer had to deal with a man of "peremptoriness and effrontery, rudeness and ribaldry". It is not recorded what New York Governor Clinton's reaction was to the news.

# Edward Antill (soldier)

After the Revolutionary War, Antill soon fell upon hard times, and he suffered a breakdown after the death of his wife Charlotte in 1785. In 1787, he left his youngest child, two-year-old Frances (Fanny) Antill, in the care of Alexander Hamilton (who was then a lawyer in New York City) and his wife Elizabeth:

Two years later, on May 23, 1789, Antill died in Canada at Saint-Jean, near Montréal.

Fanny continued to live with the Hamiltons for another eight years, until she was twelve, at which time her older sister Mary was married and able to take Fanny into her own home. Later, James Alexander Hamilton would write that Fanny "was educated and treated in all respects as [the Hamiltons'] own daughter." She later married Arthur Tappan, a prosperous merchant and abolitionist.

# Badshah Begum

Badshah Begum died in 1789 in Delhi and was buried in the Tis Hazari Bagh (Garden of Thirty Thousand) there. The garden had been commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan during his reign. Emperor Aurangzeb's daughter, Princess Zeenat-un-Nissa, was also buried in the Tis Hazari Bagh upon her death in 1721.

# Frances Brooke

Brooke died in Sleaford, England, aged 65.

# Robert Burnes

On 3 January 1789 Robert died whilst he was at Ellisland Farm. Robert was a popular and much respected figure in the area and he is buried in a prime location in Stewarton's Laigh Kirk cemetery where in 1910 the Stewarton Literary Society erected a memorial obelisk made of Ballochmyle red sandstone to him and to his eldest son John who had died on 17 February 1846 and is buried next to him. On the day of the unveiling the Stewarton Burgh Band marched through the streets and Andrew Kerr, President of the Stewarton Literary Society hosted the proceedings. The whole project had originally begun following a talk delivered by Duncan McNaught of Kilmaurs and the honour was given to him to unveil the memorial.

# George Byng (1735–1789)

He died on 27 October 1789.

# Richard Caswell

He served as the state's comptroller and as a member of the North Carolina Senate between his two gubernatorial terms. Caswell was also chosen to be one of North Carolina's delegates to the United States Constitutional Convention of 1787, but he did not attend.

Caswell was a prosperous farmer, land speculator, tanner, and Grand Master Mason of North Carolina. He had training in surveying and was appointed deputy surveyor for the colony in 1750.

At the time of his death in 1789, he had returned once again to the North Carolina General Assembly, this time serving as Speaker of the Senate. Caswell died in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on November 10, 1789. According to tradition, his body was returned to Kinston for burial in the family cemetery, near where a memorial and museum stands today.

# Thomas Collins (governor)

Collins died at Duck Creek, now Smyrna. He was buried in the Collins Family Cemetery, but his remains were later moved into the St. Peter's Episcopal Church Cemetery at Smyrna.  He was the first State President to die in office.

The Thomas Collins state office building on U.S. Highway 13 in Dover is named in his honor.

# John Cook (governor)

Cook died at Duck Creek, now Smyrna, and was buried there in an unmarked grave at St. Peter's Episcopal Church Cemetery. His daughter, Sarah, married future Governor John Clark.

No known portrait of John Cook exists.

# Charles Wolfran Cornwall

Cornwall was the first Speaker of the House of Commons to die in office. He sat in the Speaker's chair for the last time on 29 December 1788, before falling ill with a "feverish cold." He remained absent from the House for two days, but expected to return soon. On 2 January 1789 the Commons Journal records that "the Clerk at the Table acquainted the House that we was extremely sorry to inform them that Mr Speaker died this morning." An autopsy was carried out where "a large quantity of cold water was found in his stomach; and one of his collar bones turning with a sharp point to his lungs, had formed an abscess and occasioned his death."

He was buried in the chapel of the Hospital of St Cross with a monument by John Francis Moore. The majority of his estate was left to his wife for the rest of her life, and then (as the couple had no children) to the children of his distant cousin Sir George Cornewall.

# George Clavering-Cowper, 3rd Earl Cowper

Cowper died on 22 December 1789 at age 51 from dropsy. His body was returned to England and buried in Hert. His title was taken by his eldest son, George Augustus . His second son, Peter Leopold Louis Francis Nassau, inherited that title in 1799 and held it for another 38 years, which denied the title to Cowper's last son, Edward Spencer.

# Thomas Day

Day was thrown from his horse while trying to break it using kindness at Barehill, Berkshire, on 28 September 1789 and died almost instantly. He was buried at St Mary's Church, Wargrave, Berkshire.

# Silas Deane

In October 1781, Deane moved to Ghent where he could live more cheaply than in Paris. Then in March 1783, he moved to London, hoping to find investors for manufacturing ventures that he planned to pursue after he returned to North America. He toured several manufacturing towns in England in late 1783, considering plans for steam engines that could operate grist mills, even consulting James Watt for advice. He also tried to attract investors for a planned canal linking Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence River. In 1784, he published a defense of his actions during the war entitled An Address to the Free and Independent Citizens of the United States of North America.

In the fall of 1787, Deane became bedridden from an unknown illness and did not fully recover until April 1789. His condition depleted his remaining money and forced him to depend on the charity of friends. In the summer of 1788, a Frenchman named Foulloy approached Thomas Jefferson in Paris with an account book and a letter book dating from Deane's diplomatic mission, apparently stolen from Deane during his illness. Foulloy threatened to sell the books to the British government if Jefferson did not purchase them—which Jefferson eventually did after negotiating a greatly reduced price.

In 1789, Deane planned return to North America in an attempt to recoup his lost fortune and reputation. After boarding the ship Boston Packet, he became ill and died on September 23 while the ship was awaiting repairs after turning back following damage from fierce winds.

In 1959, historian Julian P. Boyd suggested that Deane might have been poisoned by Edward Bancroft, the British spy who had been employed by the American commissioners in Paris, because Bancroft might have felt threatened by Deane's possible testimony to Congress.

# Joseph Demarco

On his return to Malta, Demarco showed serious signs of physical decline. The Order of Knights Hospitallers which he loved was fatally in trouble, not only because of the revolution in France, but also for its internal bankruptcy, corruption, and loose morals. It seemed that Demarco was passing away together with a whole age.

He died at Cospicua, his home-town, on August 13, 1793, and was buried at the parish church at Cospicua.

# Benjamin Exum

He died before 1790.  Benjamin and his wife, Martha (Unknown) Exum, were the parents of three sons, Benjamin Exum Jr, William Exum, and Mathew Exum, and two daughters, Martha Exum and Tabitha Exum. Tabitha married Benjamin Smith of Wayne County.

# Richard Hillary (merchant)

Hillary died leaving estates in Yorkshire and Jamaica to his eldest son.

# Baron d'Holbach

D'Holbach is believed to have died shortly before the French Revolution. He was buried on 21 January, 1789, in the ossuarium beneath the altar in the parish church of Saint-Roch, Paris. This ossuarium has been ransacked twice, once during the French Revolution, and again during the 1871 Paris Commune.

# Kpengla

Kpengla died in 1789 from smallpox and his son Agonglo became the new king after a violent struggle in the palace that resulted in hundreds of deaths.  Agonglo largely ended Kpengla's slave trade restrictions and allowed slave traders to set their own rate.

# Andrea Negroni

# James Potter

James Potter died near Greencastle, Franklin County, Pennsylvania, in 1789 as the result of a construction injury during a barn raising in Penns Valley. He left Penns Valley and travelled to Greencastle, seeking medical help from his family doctor. His oldest daughter also lived there. He was a resident of Mifflin County at his death, and was one of Pennsylvania's largest landowners. The area of his plantation is now in Centre County.  The Potter-Allison Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

Several place names in Pennsylvania, such as Potter County and Potters Mills (in Centre County), were given in his honor.

A Pennsylvania Historical Marker near Potters Mills commemorates a Revolutionary-era fort built by General Potter. The marker was erected along State Route 144 in 1947. Its text reads:

# John Rogers (Continental Congress)

Rogers died in Annapolis in September, 1789. Although the site of his grave is unknown, a memorial marker honoring him is on the grounds of the Prince Georges County administration building.

# Nicholas Van Dyke (politician, born 1738)

Van Dyke died at Berwick, in St. George's Hundred, New Castle County, and was buried there at first. Later his remains were removed to the Immanuel Episcopal Church Cemetery at New Castle.

His son, also Nicholas, would later represent Delaware in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. His daughter, Nancy Ann, married Kensey Johns at a 1784 wedding in the Amstel House in New Castle that was attended by General George Washington. Their son, Kensey Johns, Jr., would later serve in the U.S. House.

Much of the property surrounding Van Dyke's original home Berwick was taken in 1829 for the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, but the house itself remained through the American Civil War. All the remaining lands and home are believed to have been taken when the canal was expanded in 1929. His New Castle home, now known as the Amstel House, still stands on Fourth Street in New Castle and is open to the public.

No known portrait of Nicholas Van Dyke exists.

# James Mitchell Varnum

General Varnum died in January 1789, only seven months after his arrival in Marietta, of consumption.   He was originally interred in the Mound Cemetery near the original settlement and later reburied the Oak Grove Cemetery in Marietta.

His college classmate the distinguished physician Solomon Drowne eulogized him during an oration at the one-year anniversary celebration of the founding of Marietta:

# Mary Ball Washington

After a lengthy illness, on August 25, 1789, Mary Ball Washington died of breast cancer at her home in Fredericksburg, Virginia.
