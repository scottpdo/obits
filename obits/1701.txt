# John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath

He died in London in 1701.

# Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont

He returned to New York in 1700, where he resumed actions against piracy and illegal shipping. Following a conference with the Iroquois at Albany in early 1700/1 (which Bellomont characterized as "greatest fatigue [I] ever underwent"), he returned to New York City, where he succumbed to a severe case of gout on 5 March 1700/01. He was buried in the chapel of Fort William. When the fort was dismantled, his remains were moved to the yard of St. Paul's Chapel.

Lieutenant Governor Nanfan acted as New York's governor until the arrival of Lord Cornbury in 1702. Nanfan, during his brief tenure, reached the peace agreement that eluded Bellomont. In an agreement negotiated later in 1701, the Iroquois signed an agreement putting their westernmost territorial claims (spanning from present-day Erie, Pennsylvania to Chicago and northern Michigan) under the English crown's protection.

# Sir Tristram Beresford, 3rd Baronet

In February 1687, he married Nichola Sophia Hamilton, youngest daughter of Hugh Hamilton, 1st Viscount of Glenawly,  who spent most of his career in the Swedish  army, and his second wife Susanna Balfour,  and had by her four daughters and a son. His wife grew up with John Power, 2rd Earl of Tyrone and according to a family legend they both agreed in their childhood, that whoever should die at first, should try to return and report to the other about the afterlife. In October 1693, Nichola wore one morning a black ribbon and after a request by her husband, declared that her friend had died. Shortly thereafter a letter from the earl's steward arrived, confirming her assertion. She also predicted Beresford the birth of his son and when in 1713, a clergyman presented her documents, which changed her age to forty-seven, she announced her oncoming death. Nichola told a female friend, that in the night after the earl's death, his ghost had manifested and had given her information about her future life. As a proof, that it had been no dream, a black mark then appeared at her wrist, which she later covered with a ribbon. Following this explanation Nichola expired in the presence of her friend.

Beresford himself died in 1701 and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Marcus, later raised to the Peerage of Ireland by the title Earl of Tyrone. Nichola  remarried General Richard  Gorges  of Kilbrew, County Meath,  and  had a further  six children.  Despite the romantic family  legend, her death in 1713 was probably in childbirth with her youngest daughter Lucy, who  married  firstly William St Lawrence, 14th Baron Howth, and secondly Nicholas Weldon.

# Hugh Boscawen (1625–1701)

Boscawen died on 30 May 1701 at the age of 75.

# François de Clermont-Tonnerre

He died on 15 February 1701.

# Guillaume Couture

On November 18, 1700, Couture's wife, Anne, died. In the spring of 1701, Couture was 83 years old and ill, possibly from small pox. He was moved to the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, where he died on April 4, 1701. The location of his tomb is unknown, as is the location of the tomb of Samuel de Champlain, founder of Quebec City. There is a park dedicated to Couture in Levis.

# Mildred Gale

Mildred lies buried in the grounds of St Nicholas's Church in Whitehaven. The exact whereabouts of her grave is unknown, due to several graveyard re-arrangements and a subsequent fire in the church in 1970, but a commemorative plaque is in the garden of the church.

# Bernard Granville (MP died 1701)

Granville died on 14 June 1701, aged 71 and was buried on 22 June 1701 in St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, next to Lambeth Palace, the London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was buried in the same grave as his father-in-law who died in 1699 and his wife, who died on 20 September 1701. His monument is described in Thomas Allen's 1827 work History and Antiquities of the Parish of Lambeth, 1827 as "a beautiful monument of white marble ornamented with cherubs, fruit, flowers, etc.", situated on the "north side of the stairs leading to the north gallery". In 1872 it was described as "out of sight and partially dismantled". No mention was made of it in the 1951 work Survey of London: Church of St Mary, Lambeth.

# John Hely

Within a few years,   despite his relative youth,  his health failed. In 1701,  although he felt well enough to travel on the spring assizes,  he fell ill at Ennis and died "after two days sickness" at the house of  Mr David England, who was later paid £3 for caring for him.  Burke suggests that  Hely, like many judges of the time, found  that the strain of going on assize (in particular  enduring the ordeal  of  the notoriously  bad Irish  roads)   was too much for his constitution to bear.

About 1698 the Irish born writer and publisher John Dunton, on a visit to Dublin, gave a sketch of the Irish judiciary and praised  most of them, including Hely, as "men of such reputation that no one complains of them". On the other hand, Ball  rather cynically notes that the general reaction to the news of his sudden death was not  so much grief as a widespread interest in who would be appointed to  fill his place.

His widow remarried James de Lestrille: they were named as co-defendants in her sons' lawsuit against her brother Henry in 1717.

# James II of England

  The Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, James's home during his final exile


  Tomb of James II in the parish church of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, commissioned in 1828 by George IV when the church was rebuilt.


In France, James was allowed to live in the royal château of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. James's wife and some of his supporters fled with him, including the Earl of Melfort; most, but not all, were Roman Catholic. In 1692, James's last child, Louisa Maria Teresa, was born. Some supporters in England attempted to assassinate William III to restore James to the throne in 1696, but the plot failed and the backlash made James's cause less popular. Louis XIV's offer to have James elected King of Poland in the same year was rejected, for James feared that acceptance of the Polish crown might (in the minds of the English people) render him incapable of being King of England. After Louis concluded peace with William in 1697, he ceased to offer much in the way of assistance to James.

During his last years, James lived as an austere penitent. He wrote a memorandum for his son advising him on how to govern England, specifying that Catholics should possess one Secretary of State, one Commissioner of the Treasury, the Secretary at War, with the majority of the officers in the army.

He died aged 67 of a brain haemorrhage on 16 September 1701 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. James's heart was placed in a silver-gilt locket and given to the convent at Chaillot, and his brain was placed in a lead casket and given to the Scots College in Paris. His entrails were placed in two gilt urns and sent to the parish church of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the English Jesuit college at Saint-Omer, while the flesh from his right arm was given to the English Augustinian nuns of Paris.

The rest of James's body was laid to rest in a triple sarcophagus (consisting of two wooden coffins and one of lead) at the Chapel of Saint Edmund in the Church of the English Benedictines in the Rue St. Jacques in Paris, with a funeral oration by Henri-Emmanuel de Roquette. James was not buried, but put in one of the side chapels. Lights were kept burning round his coffin until the French Revolution. In 1734, the Archbishop of Paris heard evidence to support James's canonisation, but nothing came of it. During the French Revolution, James's tomb was raided.

# Kondiaronk

Amidst the deliberations that last day of July, Kondiaronk became ill, unable to stand at the conference on 1 August. He was seated in a comfortable armchair, and after having an herbal drink made of maidenhair fern syrup, he was strong enough to speak. He spent the next two hours condemning the Iroquois for their misbehavior, and additionally, recounting his own role in conflict aversion with the Iroquois, his success in prisoner recovery, and peaceful negotiations. "We could not help but be touched," wrote La Potherie, "by the eloquence with which he expressed himself, and could not fail to recognize at the same time that he was a man of worth." He retired to his hut after speaking, too exhausted to remain at the conference. He died at two a.m.[citation needed] the next day, at the age of 52. It was because of the Rat's inspirational speeches that the remaining parties were convinced to sign the peace treaty, the Great Peace.

When his death was announced, many Iroquois, who were well known for their death and burial ceremonies, participated in covering the body of Kondiaronk in a ritual called "covering the dead". Sixty men marched in a procession led by Louis-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, with the Seneca chief Tonatakout, carrying the rear. The procession sat in a circle around the body, and a man appointed as the chanter paced and sang for a quarter of an hour. After him, a second speaker, Aouenano, wiped away the tears of the mourners, opening their throats, and pouring in a sweet re-quickening medicine. Then, after producing a belt, he restored the Sun and urged the warriors to emerge from darkness to the light of peace. Afterwards, he covered the body, which would be permanently covered later, during the Christian burial ceremony. Kondiaronk was, after all, a convert of the Jesuits.

His funeral was elaborate, and both natives and French took part. French representatives were paired with delegations of a segment of Huron-Petun society. Marching in front of the coffin were a French officer, sixty soldiers, sixteen Huron warriors, and French clergymen. The coffin was carried by six war leaders, and was covered with flowers. There rested upon the top of the coffin a gorget, a sword, and a plumed hat. Behind the coffin, Kondiaronk's relatives followed, along with the Ottawa and Huron-Petun chiefs. The wife of the intendant, Mme. De Champigny, the governor of Montreal, M. de Vaudreuil, and the entire officer corps were at the rear of the procession. The war leaders, at the grave, fired a salute. The inscription on his resting place read: Cy git le Rat, Chef des Hurons ("Here lies the Muskrat, Chief of the Hurons"). Today, there is no remaining trace of this burial place, though it is thought that he lies somewhere near the Place d'Armes.

The French idealized the deceased chief, using him to demonstrate what all chiefs should aspire to be like. They compared him to French leaders and institutions, which painted a picture of idealized chiefs who would direct consensual politics, and rule with non-coercive authority. The French envisioned these chiefs as the governors of small principalities, and emissaries of the French government. This comparison and French ideology would remain a source of tension between the natives and France until French Canada's fall in the mid-eighteenth century. In fact, Pennahouel, an Ottawa chief who consulted with General Montcalm in July 1757, was compared to Kondiaronk, and "celebrated for his spirit, his wisdom" and his easy conversation with Frenchmen. Le Rat was preserved in literature, as Adario in the Baron de Lahontan's Voyages (1703). As a result of this, he became the model for all the "noble natives" who were thereafter recorded in European literature.

# Creswell Levinz

He at once returned to the bar, and was soon busily engaged in pleading. He was one of the counsel for the Seven Bishops in 1688, defended Major John Bernardi (an alleged conspirator in the Jacobite Assassination Plot), securing the dismissal of the bill of indictment by the grand jury and, in the great habeas corpus case of Rex v. Kendall and Roe, before Lord Chief Justice Holt in 1695, he argued successfully against the legality of a committal to prison under a general warrant by a secretary of state. He died at Serjeants' Inn on 29 Jan. 1700–1, and was buried in Evenley parish church. Part of his monument there survives: a more than life-size marble statue of Levinz wearing his judge's robes and wig. He was succeeded by his son William who was a Nottinghamshire MP.

# Nur-un-Nissa Begum

Nur-un-Nissa Begum died at Kabul in February 1701. According to Niccolao Manucci, "she was in every way a most accomplished princess". Her death was a great affliction to both Muazzam and Rafi-ush-Shan. Aurangzeb, and all the courtiers came to them, and offered their condolences.

# Stanislaus Papczyński

He died on 17 September 1701, and was buried at the Church of the Lord's Cenacle in Gora Kalwaria.

# Sir Amyas Pollard, 3rd Baronet

Pollard died in 1701 and was buried before the altar in the very small parish church of Abbots Bickington, where survives his ledger stone inscribed with verse and decorated with heraldry.

# Edward Rich, 6th Earl of Warwick

He died in 1701 and was succeeded by his son Edward Rich, 7th Earl of Warwick (1698–1721).

# Joseph Williamson (politician)

Williamson died at Cobham, Kent, on 3 October 1701, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his widow joined him a year later. He had become very rich by taking advantage of the many opportunities of making money which his official position gave him; and despite the heavy debts left by her brother, his wife is also said to have brought him a fortune. He left £6,000 and his library to Queen's College, Oxford; £5,000 to found a school at Rochester, Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School; and £2,000 to Thetford. A great number of Williamson's letters, dispatches, memoranda, etc., are among the English state papers.

He has been described as one of the greatest English civil servants of his time,  and is  credited with building up an intelligence service as efficient as that which John Thurloe had operated  under  Oliver Cromwell. His detailed notes of Privy Council meetings are an invaluable source of information about its operation, especially in the political crisis of 1678–79.  On the other hand he was a poor public speaker: even Charles II, himself a very hesitant speaker, complained of his "droning".

Despite his gifts he was not popular, being described as dry, formal and arrogant, an uncertain friend and a harsh employer. Many of his colleagues,  like Sir Leoline Jenkins,   felt the lash of his sharp tongue.  On the other hand, his will, in which he remembered all those who had a claim on him, suggests that he did not lack a certain generosity of character; and he was capable of forming lifelong friendships, notably with Samuel Pepys.

# Sir Thomas Willys, 1st Baronet

Willys died on 17 November 1701. His will was dated 13 and prorated on 25 November 1701.
