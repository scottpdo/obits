# Timothy Bevan (apothecary)

He died in 1786.

# John Butler (general)

Butler died in the Fall of 1786, leaving his estate to his wife, Anne.  Eli Caruthers, an early North Carolina historian, asserted in 1854 that Butler's performances at Lindley's Mill and Elizabethtown were lackluster.  Caruthers made the claim that officers under Butler's command, particularly Colonel Robert Mebane, were justified in several incidents of insubordination in which they defied Butler's orders to retreat.  Scholars in the 20th century have shed further light on Butler's actions during the war, going so far as to praise Butler's conduct and tactical planning at Lindley's Mill.

In 1939, the State of North Carolina designed and erected a historical marker commemorating Butler's failed rescue attempt of Governor Burke at Lindley's Mill.  In 2012, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources announced that Butler's life and individual service would be commemorated by the erection of a highway historical marker in Swepsonville, North Carolina.

# John Byron

John Byron died on 10 April 1786 at home in London. His remains were buried in the Berkeley family vault situated beneath the chancel of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Twickenham.

# Pierre du Calvet

Out of prison, du Calvet left the continent for London where he intended to put governor Haldimand to trial for violating the British constitution.

In March 1784, he published The Case of Peter du Calvet to let his cause be known to the English public. Not conversant in the English language, he received the help of Francis Maseres and Petier Livius to write the document, which contains a detailed account of his confrontation with judge Fraser, his arrest, sequestration, his numerous letters asking to be trialled before a jury of his peers, etc.

In July, he published Appel à la Justice de l'État, a collection of letters to British officials and to the people of Quebec, intended to inform them of his actions to obtain both justice in his personal cause and a new constitution for the province.

The same year, Félix de Berey, mocked by du Calvet in one of his open letters, published Réplique par le P. de Berey aux calomnies de Pierre du Calvet.

To finance his lawsuit against Haldimand, he needed money. While in London he decided to cross the Atlantic to reach Philadelphia and recover the money owed to him by the American Congress. He presented himself before the Congressmen to claim the amount he believed was his, but was paid back only parts of it. On March 3, the Spanish ship transporting him to Paris left the port of New York. On March 15, the Spanish ship was declared lost in sea.

# Charles-Emmanuel de Warnery

The Polish king, Stanislaus Poniatowski, appointed him general and adjutant general in 1776, but he lived mostly in Silesia, in Langenhof near Oels, on property which his wife, Louise Henriette von Koschenbahr (19 February 1725–20 March 1799), had brought to their marriage.  He died in Breslau on 8 May 1786, a relatively young man, aged 56 years.

# Marie-Cessette Dumas

Sources differ on the date and circumstance of her death. Two documents signed by Alex Dumas—his contract and certificate of marriage to Marie-Louise Labouret—state that Marie-Cessette died in La Guinaudée, near Trou Jérémie, Saint-Domingue, in 1772. Based on this death date, Victor Emmanuel Roberto Wilson speculates that she may have died in the mass outbreak of dysentery following a devastating hurricane that struck principally the Grand'Anse region of Saint-Domingue that year. There is good reason, however, to believe that she did not die in 1772. Two other documents say Marie-Cessette remained alive after that year. The 1776 letter from Chauvinault to the Count de Maulde, cited above, states that Dumas's father Antoine sold Marie-Cessette in 1775 before returning to France. A second document, this one signed by Dumas in 1801, states "Marie-Cezette" will be in charge of General Dumas's properties in Saint-Domingue. This evidence makes it unlikely that Marie-Cessette Dumas died in 1772.[citation needed]

According to the writer Claude Ribbe, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas may have deliberately entered a false death date on the marriage certificate. He had urgent reason to claim she was dead at the moment of his marriage in Villers-Cotterêts, France, in 1792. If she were living, he would have been required to very inconveniently consult her opinion on the marital union.

# Frederick the Great

  Napoleon visits Frederick's (first) sarcophagus in the crypt of Garrison Church, Potsdam


In 1785, Frederick signed a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States of America, recognising the independence of the new nation. The agreement included a novel clause, whereby the two leaders of the executive branches of either country guaranteed a special and humane detention for prisoners of war.

Near the end of his life, Frederick grew increasingly solitary. His circle of close friends at Sanssouci gradually died off with few replacements, and Frederick became increasingly critical and arbitrary, to the frustration of the civil service and officer corps. The populace of Berlin always cheered the king when he returned to the city from provincial tours or military reviews, but Frederick evinced little pleasure from his popularity with the common people, preferring instead the company of his pet Italian greyhounds, whom he referred to as his "marquises de Pompadour" as a jibe at the French royal mistress. Even in his late 60s and early 70s when he was increasingly crippled by asthma, gout and other ailments, he rose before dawn, drank six to eight cups of coffee a day, "laced with mustard and peppercorns", and attended to state business with characteristic tenacity.

On the morning of 17 August 1786, Frederick died in an armchair in his study at Sanssouci, aged 74. He left instructions that he should be buried next to his greyhounds on the vineyard terrace, on the side of the corps de logis of Sanssouci. His nephew and successor Frederick William II instead ordered the body to be entombed next to his father in the Potsdam Garrison Church. Near the end of World War II, Hitler ordered Frederick's coffin, along with those of his father Frederick William I, World War I Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, and Hindenburg's wife Gertrud, to be hidden in a salt mine as protection from destruction. The United States Army relocated the remains to Marburg in 1946; in 1953, the coffins of Frederick and his father were moved to Burg Hohenzollern.



  Grave of Frederick at Sanssouci where he was buried only after the German reunification (he wished to rest next to his dogs, but this was originally disobeyed)


On the 205th anniversary of his death, on 17 August 1991, Frederick's casket lay in state in the court of honor at Sanssouci, covered by a Prussian flag and escorted by a Bundeswehr guard of honor. After nightfall, Frederick's body was finally laid to rest in the terrace of the vineyard of Sanssouci—in the still existing crypt he had built there—without pomp, in accordance with his will.

# Silvester Gardiner

In 1783, Dr. Gardiner spent time in St. John's, Newfoundland, and in 1784 wrote a report enumerating its resources, advocating 11 reasons for settlement. In 1785, he returned to Newport, Rhode Island, where he died the following year and was interred under Trinity Church. The Christ Episcopal Church, built in 1820 beside the Gardiner common, bears his cenotaph.

# Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham

He died on 20 July 1786, aged only 46, and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey. His widow continued to live at Grantham House until her own death in January 1830, aged 72 years.

# Nathanael Greene

See also: Confederation Period


  Portrait of Greene by John Trumbull


After resigning his commission, Greene returned to Newport. Facing a large amount of debt, he relocated to the South to focus on the plantations he had been awarded during the war, and he made his home at the Mulberry Grove Plantation outside of Savannah. Though he had spoken against slavery earlier in his life, Greene purchased slaves to work his plantations. In 1784, Greene declined appointment to a commission tasked with negotiating treaties with Native Americans, but he agreed to attend the first meeting of the Society of the Cincinnati.

Greene fell ill on June 12, 1786, and he died at Mulberry Grove on June 19, 1786, at the age of 43. For over a century, his remains were interred at the Graham Vault in Colonial Park Cemetery of Savannah, alongside John Maitland, his arch-rival in the conflict.  On November 14, 1902, through the efforts of Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati President Asa Bird Gardiner, his remains were moved to a monument in Johnson Square in Savannah.

As noted above Greene was in debt; it had come about this way: in 1782 and 1783 he had difficuly in supplying with clothing and provisions the troops in Charleston SC. He contracted with Banks & Co to furnish supplies..but was compelled to put his name to the Bond for the supplies. An order was given by Greene to Robert Morris for payment of the amount and it was paid; it was paid by the Government of the United States to the contractor – who did not use it to pay the debt and left the Bond unpaid. Greene did pay the debt and in 1791 his executric petitioned Congress for relief; Greene had obtained some security from a partner of Banks & Co named Ferrie on a mortgage or lein on a tract of land-but the land was liable to a prior mortgage of  £1,000 sterling to an Englishman named Murray; in 1788 the mortager in England filed a bill to foreclose on the mortgage; while Greene's family instituted proceedings against Ferrie  who was entitled to a revisionary interest in the land. The court ordered the land be sold and the sale proceeds first to extinguismen of the Mortgage and the balance to go to representatives of General Greene. The land was sold and after the £1,000 mortagage was to be paid off, the residue of £2,400 to Greenes representatives. The Purchaser never took title and never paid the money, on the grounds that the title was in dispute; in 1792 a relief act was passed by Congress for General Greene which was based upon the decree of the land sale; the sum of which he was entitled to £2,400 was exempted out of the imdemity allowed him at that time; not one cent of which his heirs received except $2.000. In 1830 the administratiors of Murray filed a bill of Chancery against the land; however his agent who had bought the land had not taken title to it, on the grounds there was a dispute about the land; the title was not perfected and the money never paid. From 1789 to 1840 the plantation had gone to ruin; under the original decree, the land instead of bring the sum it had first bought, it was sold for only $13,000. and left Greene representatives only about $2,000 instead of £2,400. In 1840 they applied to Congress  for the difference between the two sums. In 1854 it came before Congress for the relief of Phineas Nightingale who was administrator of General Greene deceased.

# Conrad Gugy

Conrad Gugy was described as a man of "large heart and hospitable to a fault". In those early days in Canada, transport and taverns were rare, but Gugy enthusiastically received travellers, without distinction, into his home and hospitably entertained them. He loved horses, and was known to have made a gift of them to mark the pleasure which he had taken in the society of an occasional guest.

Towards the end of his life, the owner of a neighbouring fief claimed that Gugy had been responsible for wilful damage to his property during the construction of buildings for the American refugees. In 1787, Gugy’s seigneuries were put up for auction to pay the damages for which the jury had held him liable. Shortly after, however, the judgement was reversed, and his seigneuries were saved, but it was too late for him. In Sketches of Celebrated Canadians, it was reported that following the verdict,

He gently made his way through the crowd, and, going to his lodgings, without speaking one word, entered his room and locked the door. On its being burst next morning, his cravat was founded neatly folded upon an arm of the sofa, upon which he lay in a reclining position, stone dead. He had not committed suicide; but, proud and sensative, he was absolutely killed by the humiliation of such a verdict.

Though Conrad Gugy was not married, his seigneuries were left to Elizabeth Wilkinson, who lived with him at his manor house. After her death, by his will, they were to pass to his brother, but as he had predeceased her, they were passed on to Conrad's nephew, Louis Gugy.

In 1980, a street - Rue Conrad Gugy - was named for him in Yamachiche, Quebec.

# Robert Howe (Continental Army officer)

After putting down the second Pennsylvania mutiny in 1783, Howe participated in the establishment of the Society of the Cincinnati and was the second officer to sign the national charter, with his signature appearing directly below that of von Steuben.  Howe thereafter returned to his North Carolina plantation, Kendal, which was upriver from the more famous Orton Plantation owned by Howe's distant relatives.  Also in 1783, Howe became a founding member of the North Carolina Society of the Cincinnati and was a signatory to its "Institution" or charter.  During much of 1783 and 1784, Howe returned frequently to Philadelphia, New York, and other cities in the northeast in an attempt to settle accounts and obtain back payments he claimed he was owed by Congress.  He was again forced to mortgage his plantation but eventually received a monetary settlement from Congress of $7,000 in 1785.

During 1785, Howe was appointed by the Congress of the Confederation to establish treaties with several western Indian tribes but did not actually travel with commissioners George Rogers Clark, Richard Butler, and Samuel Holden Parsons, who finalized the Treaty of Fort Finney without Howe in 1786.  Howe assisted Benjamin Smith in planning for the construction of Bald Head Light and actively worked to assist former Loyalists who sought to return to their prior lives in North Carolina by defending them against the judiciary of the state.

In the summer of 1786, he was elected a member of the North Carolina House of Commons.  On his way to a meeting of the legislative body, Howe fell ill, and died on December 14, 1786, in Bladen County.  Howe's remains were buried on property he owned in what later became Columbus County, North Carolina, although the exact location of his burial has not been discovered.  A cenotaph was placed in Southport's Old Smithville Burying Ground honoring him and wife Sara.

# Alexander Lillington

He was buried in the Lillington Cemetery, Rocky Point, Pender County, North Carolina.

# Abraham Lincoln (captain)

  Modern grave marker at the traditional site of Lincoln's cabin


One day in May 1786, Abraham Lincoln was working in his field with his three sons when he was shot from the nearby forest and fell to the ground. The eldest boy, Mordecai, ran to the cabin where a loaded gun was kept, while the middle son, Josiah, ran to Hughes' Station for help. Thomas, the youngest, stood in shock by his father. From the cabin, Mordecai observed a Native American come out of the forest and stop by his father's body. The Native American reached for Thomas, either to kill him or to carry him off. Mordecai took aim and shot the Indian in the chest, killing him.

Tradition states that Captain Abraham Lincoln was buried next to his cabin, which is now the site of Long Run Baptist Church and Cemetery near Eastwood, Kentucky. A stone memorializing Captain Abraham Lincoln was placed in the cemetery in 1937.

Bathsheba Lincoln was left a widow with five underage children. She moved the family away from the Ohio River, to Washington County, where the country was more thickly settled and there was less danger of a Native American attack. Under the law then operating, Mordecai Lincoln, as the eldest son, inherited two-thirds of his father's estate when he reached the age of twenty-one, with Bathsheba receiving one-third. The other children inherited nothing. Life was hard, particularly for Thomas, the youngest, who got little schooling and was forced to go to work at a young age.

In later years Thomas Lincoln would recount the story of the day his father died, to his son, Abraham Lincoln, the future sixteenth president of the United States of America.  "The story of his death by the Indians," the president later wrote, "and of Uncle Mordecai, then fourteen years old, killing one of the Indians, is the legend more strongly than all others imprinted on my mind and memory."

# John Martin (Governor of Georgia)

The Georgia Gazette of February 2, 1786, contained this record: "Last week died, on his way to the Westward, whither he was bound for the recovery of his health, the Hon. John Martin, Esq."

The town of Martin, in Stephens County, is named in his honor.

# Moses Mendelssohn

Mendelssohn died on January 4, 1786 as the result (it was thought at the time) of a cold contracted while carrying a manuscript (his reply to Jacobi, titled To Lessing's Friends (An die Freunde Lessings)) to his publishers on New Year's Eve; Jacobi was held by some to have been responsible for his death. He was buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Berlin. The translation of the Hebrew inscription on his gravestone (see picture below, right) reads: H[ere] r[ests] / the wise R[eb] Moses of Dessau / born on the 12th of Elul 5489 [September 6, 1729] / died on Wednesday the 5th of Shevat [January 4] / and buried the next morning on Thursday 6th/ 5546 [January 5, 1786] / M[ay] H[is] S[oul be] B[ound up in the] B[ond of eternal] L[ife] Although the cemetery was largely destroyed during the Nazi era, after German reunification, in 2007-2008, it was reestablished with monuments to its past, including a recreation of Mendelssohn's gravestone.

# Moluntha

Immediately before Logan's Raid commenced, Benjamin Logan ordered his men not to kill any of the Shawnee that  chose to surrender. During the battle, Moluntha was cornered by William Lytle and surrendered to him. Moluntha was brought into the custody of Hugh McGary, and Logan reiterated his order that the prisoners not be harmed. McGary, who was still bitter about his defeat at the Battle of Blue Licks, asked Moluntha, "Were you at the defeat of the Blue Licks?" The aged chief misunderstood the question and answered in the affirmative. McGary immediately killed Moluntha with an axe. Logan relieved McGary of command and court-martialed him.

Moluntha's son, Spemica-Lawba, survived Logan's raid. He was brought back to Kentucky and raised by Benjamin Logan, eventually became known as Captain Logan.

Tecumseh cited Moluntha's death as an example of broken promises by the United States.

# Abner Nash

Later in 1782, North Carolina eased political tensions by sending Nash as a delegate to the Continental Congress.  He would serve there the rest of his life, as he died at a session in New York City.  Abner was originally buried in St. Paul's Churchyard in Manhattan, but his body was later returned for burial in a private, family plot in Craven County, North Carolina.

# Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland

Hugh died in 1786 and was buried in the Northumberland Vault, within Westminster Abbey.

# Jean-Baptiste Marie de Piquet, Marquess of Méjanes

He moved to Paris in 1783, where he died on 5 October 1786 without a descendent, his son Joseph Marie Marc Antoine de Piquet having died on 4 August 1760 at the age of 6 months and a half. His sole heir was his nephew, the Marquis de Lagoy.

In his will, he bequeathed all his books, between 60,000 and 80,000 volumes, to Provence, under the stipulation that they be made accessible to ordinary citizens. He also added a yearly legacy of 5,000 books in annuities for Provence, to continue increasing the number of the collection. This bequest led to the creation of the public library of Aix-en-Provence known as the Bibliothèque Méjanes. His bust, designed by Jean-Antoine Houdon, is displayed in the library.

# Carl Wilhelm Scheele

In the fall of 1785, Scheele began to suffer from symptoms described as kidney disease. In early 1786, he also contracted a disease of the skin, which, combined with kidney problems, so enfeebled him that he could foresee an early death. With this in mind, he married the widow of his predecessor, Pohl, two days before he died, so that he could pass undisputed title to his pharmacy and his possessions to her.

While Scheele's experiments generated substances which have long since been found to be hazardous, the compounds and elements he used to start his experiments were dangerous to begin with, especially heavy metals. Like most of his contemporaries, in an age where there were few methods of chemical characterisation, Scheele would smell and taste any new substances he discovered. Cumulative exposure to arsenic, mercury, lead, their compounds, and perhaps hydrofluoric acid which he had discovered, and other substances took their toll on Scheele, who died at the early age of 43, on 21 May 1786, at his home in Köping. Doctors said that he died of mercury poisoning.

# Gilbert Stuart (writer)

Stuart would spend whole nights drinking in company at the Peacock in Gray's Inn Lane, London. He died at his father's house at Fisherrow in Musselburgh on 13 August 1786.

# Thomas Thistlewood

Burnard also suggests that Jamaica was very different from the Colony of Virginia where the political offices such as vestrymen and justices of the peace tended to be dominated by wealthier planters. Jamaica, however, did not have as many wealthy whites to fill such offices and thus had to draw on the services of white men with average wealth like Thistlewood. Because of the relative scarcity of whites, says Burnard, Jamaica experienced a greater spirit of white independence, white pride, and white egalitarianism than existed in much of colonial British America. Working class white men behaved as if they were the equal of the wealthiest white planters, in stark contrast with the class system that was entrenched in Britain, their country of origin.

He never returned to England, and died at Breadnut Island, Jamaica in November 1786. 

Thistlewood called Phibbah his "wife" in the will that freed her. William Tomlinson, acting on behalf of Thistlewood's estate, paid £80 to Cope to free Phibbah on 26 November 1792.

When Thistlewood died at the age of 65, his estate of £3,000 and 34 slaves was rather modest by Jamaican standards but quite substantial with regards to other British colonies.

# Tench Tilghman

  Washington, Lafayette & Tilghman at Yorktown, by Charles Willson Peale, 1784


The National Park Service writes that Tilghman was even sick during his ride from Yorktown to Philadelphia "with chills and fever" and that he left the army in 1783 with failing health. Nonetheless, he restarted his business after the war, shipping wheat, tobacco, and other American products to Spain, in exchange for which Valentin Riera [head of a Spanish company] shipped wine and manufactured products to Baltimore.

On June 9, 1783, in St. Michael's Parish, Tilghman married Anna Maria Tilghman, his first cousin and daughter of Matthew Tilghman. Together they had two children Anna Margaretta, born May 24, 1784 and Elizabeth Tench, born October 11, 1786.

Tilghman was an original member of the Maryland Society of the Cincinnati.  He died in Chestertown, Maryland, on April 18, 1786, at the age of 41.

Washington's regard for Tilghman can be inferred from their joint portrait with Lafayette, by Charles Wilson Peale After Tilghman's death, Washington wrote to his brother Thomas Ringgold Tilghman and to his father James Tilghman:



As there were few men for whom I had a warmer friendship, or greater regard than for your Brother—Colonel Tilghman—when living; so, with much truth I can assure you, that, there are none whose death I could more sincerely have regretted. and I pray you, & his numerous friends to permit me to mingle my sorrows with theirs on this unexpected & melancholy occasion.


Of all the numerous acquaintances of your lately deceased son, & amidst all the sorrowings that are mingled on that melancholy occasion, I may venture to assert that (excepting those of his nearest relatives) none could have felt his death with more regret than I did—No one entertained a higher opinion of his worth, or had imbibed sentiments of greater friendship for him than I had done.

# Sarah Maria Wilson

Wilson did not act after the 1785 season, and died in Edinburgh in 1786.

# Patience Wright

Wright returned to England in 1782 and settled with her daughter Phoebe and her son-in-law, painter John Hoppner at their home on Charles Street at St. James's Square. By 1785 she had decided to return to New Jersey. However, as she was making preparations to travel, she suffered a bad fall and broke her leg. Patience Wright died a week later, on March 23, 1786. Her sister Rachel attempted to get financial assistance for her burial expenses, both from prominent American citizens and then from the Continental Congress, but was not successful. Wright was buried in London. Her burial place is unknown.

Although Wright had obtained George Washington's agreement to sit for a portrait with her, she died before she could sculpt him. A similar request sent to Thomas Jefferson would go unanswered.

# Thomas Wright (astronomer)

Wright died in 1786 in Byers Green and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's, South Church, Bishop Auckland. He was survived by his illegitimate daughter.

# Yi Byeok

Early in 1785, the growing group of believers and sympathizers moved their regular gatherings for worship from the house of Yi Byeok to that belonging to another convert, Kim Beom-u, on the hill where Myeongdong Cathedral now stands. Kim was not an aristocrat as so many of the others were. Almost immediately, the authorities raided the house, suspecting it of being a gambling den, and were embarrassed on finding it full of nobles. A report by a government agent to the Minister of Justice  lists those acting as leaders: Yi Seung-hun, the brothers Jeong Yak-jeon, Jeong Yak-jong, Jeong Yak-yong, Gwon Il-sin, with Yi Byeok taking the leading role as teacher during the ceremony.

All were arrested, the books that were found were confiscated, and the nobles were then sent home with a warning not to continue. However, Kim Beom-u was tortured, exiled, and finally executed since he was not of noble birth.

Dallet (Vol 1 pages 28–9) says that Yi Byeok was put under intense pressure from his father until finally, more or less, he gave up the faith. He was tormented by remorse until he died of the plague in 1786. A different account of his death is given by Antton Iraola who reported that he died on 14 June 1785, after 15 days of constant prayer, during which he neither ate nor slept. What seems clear is that his family, under strong pressure from the Confucian leaders that were hostile to the Namin and their newly found foreign faith, kept him more or less imprisoned in his home. There is no record of any communication addressed to the Catholic community emanating from him after the arrest.

The group's leadership was taken by Yi Seung-hun, who seemed to have established a native hierarchy, at least before the Bishop of Beijing intervened to stop it.

Yi Byeok's life is poorly documented and the main source for much information about him is the rather dramatized account in Dallet's Histoire de l’église de Corée (2 vols, 1874), which relied heavily on translations of documents sent to France by Bishop Daveluy (Dallet, Histoire, Vol.1, Introduction, page xi).
