# Georg David Anthon

Anthon died on August 30, 1781.

# John Ashe (general)

Returning to Wilmington, he remained active there in suppressing Loyalist activity in the district. He was captured and held as a prisoner of war following the town's occupation in 1781 by the army of General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis.  

Contracting smallpox while imprisoned, Ashe was paroled, but died in Sampson County on October 24 shortly after his release.

# Edward Barnard (provost)

He died on 2 December 1801. A tablet to his memory, with an inscription, is in Eton College Chapel. Barnard, according to Hardinge, was a man of coarse features and clumsy figure, but with a humour and vivacity which, but for his physical disadvantages, would have made him the equal of Garrick; and he ruled his boys chiefly by force of ridicule. Upon Barnard's death Johnson, according to Mrs Piozzi, pronounced a long eulogium upon his wit, learning, and goodness, and added: 'He was the only man that did justice to my good breeding, and you may observe that I am well bred to a needless degree of scrupulosity.' He is not to be confounded with Thomas Barnard, the bishop of Killaloe and Limerick, who was also a friend of Johnson.

# George Bogle (diplomat)

Bogle died, probably of cholera, on 3 April 1781, and was buried in South Park Street Cemetery, Calcutta. He had never married, but left behind a son George, and two daughters, Martha and Mary. According to family lore, the girls' mother was Tibetan. The two girls were sent back to Daldowie House, where they were brought up by Bogle's family and eventually married Scotsmen.

# William Bryan (North Carolina politician)

He died in Johnston County, North Carolina, on November 28, 1781.  Some biographers say that he and his son Lewis were poisoned by one of his slaves.  The Johnston County Court minutes for November 1780 give an account of the trial and conviction of a slave named Jenny, who poisoned Needham Bryan and other members of his family.  Jenny was burned at the stake in Smithfield, North Carolina, for the murders of three members of the Bryan family.

# Walter Butler (Loyalist)

Butler died in a skirmish on October 30, 1781. The telling of the details was of apparent great interest to his contemporaries; perhaps no other Loyalist in upstate New York was as hated as Walter Butler. Several men who were present during the event or shortly thereafter testified to the specifics in their (Revolutionary War) pension applications [RWPA].

No word is recorded as to the disposition of Butler's body and it is doubtful that the Rebel forces did him the honor of burying him, Ross' men being actively pursued by them.

# Henry Cheere

Upon his death, his son William Cheere succeeded him as 2nd Baronet, but died unmarried in 1808. Sir Henry also had a daughter, Charles Cheere (1735–1799).

According to the Pevsner Buildings of England series guides, Henry Cheere was “the first English-born sculptor to match the virtuosity of the continentals” and “formed his style on the small, crisp, curvaceous shapes of the French sculptor [Roubiliac], though his monuments never approached Roubiliac’s in ease and inventiveness. Much of his work is unsigned, as is his commonly considered c.1760 masterpiece at Shadoxhurst, Kent.

# Thomas Crofts

During the late 1770s Crofts' health began to deteriorate.  He sold his large collection of coins to Hunter in January 1781 and died at the home of the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam at Milton Park, Northamptonshire on 8th Nov that year.

A tribute in the 'Biographical Memoirs of William Bowyer' described Crofts as "distinguished for his general attainments as well as antient erudition . . gleaned . . not of reading only but of intelligent travels".  His extensive library was sold in over 8000 lots over 43 days in 1783.  Copies of the Catalogue of the Sale 'Bibliotheca Croftsiana . . ' are still in existence and his books now reside in some of the important collections of the world.

# John Parke Custis

Custis served as a civilian aide-de-camp to Washington during the siege of Yorktown. However, Custis contracted "camp fever", which could have been an illness now described as epidemic typhus, or dysentery  while at Yorktown. Shortly after the surrender of Cornwallis, Custis died on November 5, 1781, in New Kent County at Eltham, Virginia, in the home of Colonel and Mrs. Burwell Bassett, brother-in-law and sister of Martha Washington. He was buried at his family's plot near Queen's Creek in York County, near Williamsburg, Virginia.

With Custis's premature death at age 26, his widow sent her two youngest children (Eleanor and George) to Mount Vernon to be raised by the Washingtons. In 1783, she married Dr. David Stuart of Alexandria, Virginia, with whom she had 16 more children.

Although Custis had become well-established at Abingdon, his financial matters were in a state of disarray due to his poor business judgement and wartime taxation. After his death in 1781, it took the administrators of the Custis Estate more than a decade to negotiate an end to the transaction through which Custis had purchased Abingdon. Because he died intestate, his estate was not fully liquidated until the 1811 death of his  widow; his four children inherited more than 600 slaves.

Part of the Abingdon estate is now on the grounds of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport At the time that he purchased Abingdon, Custis also bought a nearby property that after his death became the Arlington Plantation and later, Arlington National Cemetery.

# Đỗ Thanh Nhơn

In 1781, Nguyễn Ánh pretended to be ill and asked Đỗ Thanh Nhơn to visit him. Unaware of his leader's trap, Nhơn came to the palace and was killed by Nguyễn Ánh's bodyguards. The reason for this assassination remains unclear, but it was postulated that Nguyễn Ánh did so because Nhon's fame and military success was overshadowing him.

Although Nguyễn Ánh foresaw the rebellion of Đỗ Thanh Nhơn's supporters following their leader's assassination, he could not prevent it, thus badly weakening the Nguyễn army. Moreover, Nhơn's death also led to the recapture of Saigon by the Tây Sơn rebels shortly thereafter because Nhơn was the Nguyễn officer that they feared the most and the forces were disunited following his death.

# Jehu Eyre

Eyre died of malaria in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his diaries were later published as The Memorials of Colonel Jehu Eyre. In 1853, his remains were taken from the Coates family graveyard and re-interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, where an Eyre family vault was constructed.

# Christopher Greene

Colonel Greene and Major Ebenezer Flagg, along with several black soldiers, were killed on May 13 or 14, 1781, when a group of loyalist insurgents surrounded Greene's headquarters on the Croton River in Westchester County, New York. From one account of the attack, "his body was found in the woods, about a mile distant from his tent, cut, and mangled in the most shocking way." A common conjecture is that this indignity was retribution for his leading black soldiers against the British Crown.

Colonel Greene and Major Flagg were buried in the cemetery of the First Presbyterian Church in Yorktown, New York.  A large memorial was placed over their graves by the State of New York.

# James Hogun

Rather than allowing himself to be paroled, Hogun requested he be taken prisoner, and was interned at the British prison camp at Haddrel's Point on Point Pleasant, located in what is now Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, across from Sullivan's Island. Hogun's decision was based, in part, on his desire to stifle the recruiting efforts of the British, who sought to enlist captured Continental soldiers to serve in the British West Indies. The British, however, held only the officers at Haddrel's Point, deciding to house the enlisted men in barracks in Charleston.

Officers at Haddrel's Point were subjected to harsh treatment, barred from fishing to catch much-needed food, and threatened with deportation from South Carolina. Approximately 3,300 Patriot soldiers were confined in prison camps around Charleston that were similar to the one at Haddrel's Point, and many were destined for cramped, unsanitary prison ships.  Because of the conditions, many Continental soldiers agreed to join Loyalist regiments, but Hogun and other officers set up courts martial in the camps and attempted to maintain a dignified military structure.  Hogun's health soon declined, and he died in the prison camp on January 4, 1781.  He was buried in an unmarked grave.

# José Francisco de Isla

De Isla died in Bologna in extreme poverty in 1781. His last book, Cartas de Juan de la Encina (Letters from Juan de la Encina), published posthumously (1784), constituted a sharp condemnation of the practices of the Spanish physicians of his time. In 1803 the priest, José Ignacio de Salas printed his biography in Madrid and in the Ibarra workshop, under the title Compendio histórico de la vida, carácter moral y literario del célebre padre Isla con la noticia analítica de todos sus escritos (Compendium history of the life, moral and literary character of the famous father Isla with analytical notes on all his writings), paid for by his devoted sister, who was also the editor of many other works by her brother.

# Jean-Esprit Isnard

He died in 1781 in Tarascon, where he is buried.

# Prince Levan of Georgia

Prince Levan, aged 25, died on 5 February 1781 at the mansion of Prince Ioane Abashidze in the village of Vejini in Kakheti, under circumstances that have remained unresolved. Although a homicide was immediately suspected, the inquiry into the case failed to reveal a murderer. Allegations that Levan was stabbed to death by Prince Asat Vachnadze for taking liberties with his wife, that Levan died after "eating too much salmon" that day, or that he was poisoned by Prince Shermazan Abkhazi were never confirmed, but suspicion that Levan fell victim to political intrigues has persisted to this day.

The loss of his favorite son was a blow to the aging King Heraclius and the regular army which Levan had commanded gradually crumbled after his death. The 19th-century British historian and Indian Army officer William Monteith, who met Heraclius's son, Alexander, in Iran in the 1820s, wrote of Levan: "He appeared to be endowed with most of the better qualities and much of the talent of his father, who might have hoped to find in him a successor capable of governing his distracted country; but he was assassinated at Telav by a Georgian, and with him perished the last hopes of Heraklius."

Levan's death was mourned in their elegies by his contemporary poets such as his personal friend Besiki, David the Rector, Molla Panah Vagif, and Molla Vali Vidadi. He is also praised in folk poetry.

# Andrew Lewis (soldier)

Lewis remained active in the legislature, and in 1780, Governor Thomas Jefferson appointed him to the Executive Council. The following year, Lewis fell ill while returning home from a council meeting; he died of fever in Bedford County on September 26. He was buried in the family plot at his home. His grave site was not marked. Colonel Elijah McClanahan, who married Lewis' granddaughter, Agatha Lewis McClanahan, attended his funeral as a young man, and later identified his grave to Roanoke County's Clerk of the Court. In 1887 General Lewis' remains were re-interred in the East Hill Cemetery at Salem, Virginia.

# Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica)

In 1781, Three-Fingered Jack was killed by a party of Maroons. Some historians and contemporary writers claimed that a single Maroon named James Reeder killed Jack in hand-to-hand combat, securing his freedom as a result. Colonial records show that Jack was killed by a party of Maroons led by the white superintendent of Scott's Hall (Jamaica), Bernard Nalty, and included Maroon warriors from Charles Town, Jamaica such as John Reeder, Samuel Grant and a young Maroon warrior named Little Quaco. These Maroons were already freedmen when they killed Jack.

Several of Jack's lieutenants were tried at the court in Yallahs, and sentenced to death. However, other deputies of Jack's continued to lead his runaway community in the years that followed his death. The Assembly offered rewards for the apprehension or killing of two of Jack's deputies, Dagger and Toney. In 1792, the colonial militia captured Dagger, and sentenced him to be resold into slavery in the Spanish colonies, but they were unable to catch Toney or the rest of Jack's community, which continued to live and thrive in the Blue Mountains.

In 1798, when he was approaching old age, Reeder petitioned the Jamaican Assembly for a pension, detailing his role in killing Three Fingered Jack, and he received his annual pension three years later. When he died in 1816 in Charles Town, and was buried in a Maroon funeral, Little Quaco, who had by now converted to Christianity and was now named William Carmichael Cockburn, petitioned the Assembly for his pension, and it was granted to him.

# Mirza Mazhar Jan-e-Janaan

Mirzā Mazhar was shot and seriously injured on the 7th of Muharram, of the year 1195 AH/1780 CE. The author of Āb-i Ḥayāt writes:

It should be noted that the author of Āb-i Ḥayāt, a determined Shi'a, has been suspected of indulging in partisan religious bias. Professor Frances Pritchett has noted that the latter account of the death of Mirzā Mazhar in Āb-i Ḥayāt is a deliberate distortion. Professor Friedmann, as well as Annemarie Schimmel and Itzchad Weismann, have all noted that Mirzā Mazhar was killed by a Shi'ite zealot.

Most of his Urdu biographers have also written that he was killed by a gunshot by a Shi'ite on 7th Muharram, and he died on 10th Muharram 1195 AH.

# Sébastien Bigot de Morogues

He died on August 26, 1781 in  Villefallier, near Orléans, France.

# Francis Peirson

Following the capture and imprisonment of Major Moses Corbet, Commander of the Jersey Garrison, by French troops on 6 January 1781, Peirson refused French demands to surrender and took command of the Garrison. Peirson ordered his troops to hold their ground at the center of the island, and he repelled several French attacks on the position. However, he was shot in the heart by a musket ball, and died. During and after his death, the troops under his command were victorious in the Battle of Jersey.

# Thomas Pichon

Pichon retreated to London in 1757, where he entered on an affair with the French novelist Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, whose marriage had been annulled.  Never a master of the English language, in 1769 he moved to Saint Helier, Jersey (a remnant of the Norman conquest where French was spoken) in which place he died on 22 November 1781.

Thomas Pichon left behind a very large collection of documents. They are held by the Bibliothèque municipale de Vire, in Normandy, France. His 1760 book on Cape Breton Island -- Genuine letters and memoirs relating to the natural, civil, and commercial history of the islands of Cape Breton and Saint John : from the first settlement there, to the taking of Louisbourg by the English in 1758—published in both English and French shortly after the conquest of Louisbourg in 1758, was the first such history of that island.

Pichon has been called repeatedly Le Judas de l'Acadie by a 20th century French-Canadian priest-historian, and elsewhere his conduct has been uniformly deplored.

# Margaret Rolle, 15th Baroness Clinton

Lady Clinton died 1781 at Pisa in Tuscany, and was buried at Leghorn. Her friend, the Countess of Huntingdon (formerly Lady Selina Shirley), later declared that she was "a woman of very singular character and considered half mad."

# Henry Thrale

On 1 April 1777 Henry's death was falsely reported in the newspapers, and threw James Boswell into "a state of very uneasy uncertainty".

On 8 or 11 June 1779, Thrale went to the house of his sister – Mrs Susannah Nesbitt – to read the will of her husband Arnold Nesbitt, MP for Cricklade. During the meal, Henry had his first stroke. Read more >> The second stroke came on 19 or 21 February 1780; on 10 September he had a third, while canvassing constituents during the 1780 general election campaign.

The strokes were largely caused by Henry's voracious appetite for large indulgent meals, accompanied by large quantities of ale.

Henry Thrale died in London at 5 a.m. 4 April 1781, with his wife and Johnson by his side. He was buried in the crypt of St. Leonards Church, Streatham. Henry's epitaph was written by Samuel Johnson.

# Túpac Amaru II

Amaru II was sentenced to be executed. He was forced to bear witness to the execution of his wife Micaela Bastidas, his eldest son Hipólito, his uncle Francisco Tupa Amaro, his brother-in-law Antonio Bastidas, and some of his captains before his own death.

The following is an extract from the official judicial death issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns Túpac Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered in sentence that Túpac Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out, after watching the executions of his family, and to have his hands and feet tied...  

After the failed dismemberment by the four horses, his body was quartered, and he was then beheaded on the main plaza in Cuzco, in the same place his apparent great-great-great-grandfather Túpac Amaru I had been beheaded.

# Emily Warren (courtesan)

Pott returned from India and the couple married. They sailed off to India to start a new life, much to the disapproval of Pott's father. Between Madras and Calcutta Warren died of a fever. Pott was so distraught that he had her coffin placed in a small boat that was towed behind the ship. On arrival in Calcutta her body was interred in the holy burial ground by the Hooghly River. Potts commissioned an architect, Mr Tiretta, to construct a mausoleum for her over the grave at a cost of £3,000 and a column for an additional £1,000.
