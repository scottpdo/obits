# Georg David Anthon

Anthon died on August 30, 1781.

# John Ashe (general)

Returning to Wilmington, he remained active there in suppressing Loyalist activity in the district. He was captured and held as a prisoner of war following the town's occupation in 1781 by the army of General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis.  

Contracting smallpox while imprisoned, Ashe was paroled, but died in Sampson County on October 24 shortly after his release.

# Edward Barnard (provost)

He died on 2 December 1801. A tablet to his memory, with an inscription, is in Eton College Chapel. Barnard, according to Hardinge, was a man of coarse features and clumsy figure, but with a humour and vivacity which, but for his physical disadvantages, would have made him the equal of Garrick; and he ruled his boys chiefly by force of ridicule. Upon Barnard's death Johnson, according to Mrs Piozzi, pronounced a long eulogium upon his wit, learning, and goodness, and added: 'He was the only man that did justice to my good breeding, and you may observe that I am well bred to a needless degree of scrupulosity.' He is not to be confounded with Thomas Barnard, the bishop of Killaloe and Limerick, who was also a friend of Johnson.

# George Bogle (diplomat)

Bogle died, probably of cholera, on 3 April 1781, and was buried in South Park Street Cemetery, Calcutta. He had never married, but left behind a son George, and two daughters, Martha and Mary. According to family lore, the girls' mother was Tibetan. The two girls were sent back to Daldowie House, where they were brought up by Bogle's family and eventually married Scotsmen.

# William Bryan (North Carolina politician)

He died in Johnston County, North Carolina, on November 28, 1781.  Some biographers say that he and his son Lewis were poisoned by one of his slaves.  The Johnston County Court minutes for November 1780 give an account of the trial and conviction of a slave named Jenny, who poisoned Needham Bryan and other members of his family.  Jenny was burned at the stake in Smithfield, North Carolina, for the murders of three members of the Bryan family.

# Walter Butler (Loyalist)

Butler died in a skirmish on October 30, 1781. The telling of the details was of apparent great interest to his contemporaries; perhaps no other Loyalist in upstate New York was as hated as Walter Butler. Several men who were present during the event or shortly thereafter testified to the specifics in their (Revolutionary War) pension applications [RWPA].



Concerning the events of that day, Henry Shaver, one of forty white men chosen at Fort Plank by Lieutenant Colonel Marinus Willett to accompany a band of Oneida Indians under the command of Colonel Lewis Cook in pursuit of Major John Ross forces after the Battle of Johnstown, stated ... "That he" [Butler] "cried out to his pursuers to "Shoot and be damned" which he had no sooner done than he was struck by a Ball from one Louis [the words "An Oneida" are crossed out] The Indian [the word "swam:" is crossed out here] waded over [the words "and tomahawked" are crossed out] and scalped him." ... The words of Shaver are echoed by Richard Casler who states ... "When Willett's men came upon the enemy they were drying their cloaths by fires & were surprised at that place Walter Butler was killed by an indian (he believes) an Oneida indian. He (Casler) was there & saw the indian who killed Butler & who had Butlers Coat and scalp The indian shot Butler from across the Creek Butlers Sergeant was also killed at this place." ... John Stalker also states that ... "Col. Butler was killed by an Indian by the name of Lewey who had the command of the American Indians."... But, Nicholas Smith & John Kennada both state that the Indian who shot Butler was "Saucy Nic:", not "Louis", and Rozel Holmes states that it was "Harmanus", a Schoharie Indian, who actually killed Butler and scalped him. Thus it is doubtful we will never know which one of these three men actually dispatched Mister Butler, but there is no doubt that he was killed and scalped. Concerning the fate of Walter's body, John Canada [sic: John Kenneda] testifying in favor of Tall William receiving a Revolutionary War Pension stated: ... "That he was together with the said Tall William engaged in a battle at West Canada Creek in which Col. Butler was shot through the head and killed and in which the enemy were defeated and after the battle was over I took from the pocket of Col. Butler a half guinea and Black William took the shoe Buckles from his feet and saucy Nick another member of our Tribe [the words "took his" are crossed out here] & the one who shot Col. Butler took his [a "u" is crossed out here] Clothing and occasionally after that wore the same". ...
 

No word is recorded as to the disposition of Butler's body and it is doubtful that the Rebel forces did him the honor of burying him, Ross' men being actively pursued by them.

# Henry Cheere

Upon his death, his son William Cheere succeeded him as 2nd Baronet, but died unmarried in 1808. Sir Henry also had a daughter, Charles Cheere (1735–1799).

According to the Pevsner Buildings of England series guides, Henry Cheere was “the first English-born sculptor to match the virtuosity of the continentals” and “formed his style on the small, crisp, curvaceous shapes of the French sculptor [Roubiliac], though his monuments never approached Roubiliac’s in ease and inventiveness. Much of his work is unsigned, as is his commonly considered c.1760 masterpiece at Shadoxhurst, Kent.

# Thomas Crofts

During the late 1770s Crofts' health began to deteriorate.  He sold his large collection of coins to Hunter in January 1781 and died at the home of the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam at Milton Park, Northamptonshire on 8th Nov that year.

A tribute in the 'Biographical Memoirs of William Bowyer' described Crofts as "distinguished for his general attainments as well as antient erudition . . gleaned . . not of reading only but of intelligent travels".  His extensive library was sold in over 8000 lots over 43 days in 1783.  Copies of the Catalogue of the Sale 'Bibliotheca Croftsiana . . ' are still in existence and his books now reside in some of the important collections of the world.

# John Parke Custis

Custis served as a civilian aide-de-camp to Washington during the siege of Yorktown. However, Custis contracted "camp fever", which could have been an illness now described as epidemic typhus, or dysentery  while at Yorktown. Shortly after the surrender of Cornwallis, Custis died on November 5, 1781, in New Kent County at Eltham, Virginia, in the home of Colonel and Mrs. Burwell Bassett, brother-in-law and sister of Martha Washington. He was buried at his family's plot near Queen's Creek in York County, near Williamsburg, Virginia.

With Custis's premature death at age 26, his widow sent her two youngest children (Eleanor and George) to Mount Vernon to be raised by the Washingtons. In 1783, she married Dr. David Stuart of Alexandria, Virginia, with whom she had 16 more children.

Although Custis had become well-established at Abingdon, his financial matters were in a state of disarray due to his poor business judgement and wartime taxation. After his death in 1781, it took the administrators of the Custis Estate more than a decade to negotiate an end to the transaction through which Custis had purchased Abingdon. Because he died intestate, his estate was not fully liquidated until the 1811 death of his  widow; his four children inherited more than 600 slaves.

Part of the Abingdon estate is now on the grounds of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport At the time that he purchased Abingdon, Custis also bought a nearby property that after his death became the Arlington Plantation and later, Arlington National Cemetery.

# Đỗ Thanh Nhơn

In 1781, Nguyễn Ánh pretended to be ill and asked Đỗ Thanh Nhơn to visit him. Unaware of his leader's trap, Nhơn came to the palace and was killed by Nguyễn Ánh's bodyguards. The reason for this assassination remains unclear, but it was postulated that Nguyễn Ánh did so because Nhon's fame and military success was overshadowing him.

Although Nguyễn Ánh foresaw the rebellion of Đỗ Thanh Nhơn's supporters following their leader's assassination, he could not prevent it, thus badly weakening the Nguyễn army. Moreover, Nhơn's death also led to the recapture of Saigon by the Tây Sơn rebels shortly thereafter because Nhơn was the Nguyễn officer that they feared the most and the forces were disunited following his death.

# Jehu Eyre

Eyre died of malaria in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his diaries were later published as The Memorials of Colonel Jehu Eyre. In 1853, his remains were taken from the Coates family graveyard and re-interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, where an Eyre family vault was constructed.
