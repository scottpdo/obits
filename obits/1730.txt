# Pope Benedict XIII

Benedict XIII was suddenly attacked by a catarrh caused by his officiating at the funeral service of Cardinal Marco Antonio Ansidei, of which he died on 21 February 1730 at the age of 81. His death was made public to the people the next day.



  The tomb of Benedict XIII


The pope was of middling size; his countenance was mild, his nose aquiline and he had a broad forehead. At the autopsy, it was discovered that his heart was remarkably large. His funeral ceremonies were performed at the Vatican, whence he was removed to the Santa Maria sopra Minerva where he was buried in a tomb completed by Pietro Bracci and others.

After the next papal election elevated Pope Clement XII to the pontificate, Clement excommunicated Benedict XIII's corrupt deputy, Cardinal Coscia. Coscia fled Rome and his punishment, but was later restored and took part in the conclaves of 1730 and 1740.

Pope Benedict XIV would later say of Benedict XIII: "We respectfully love that pontiff who backed his carriage rather than dispute the passage with a cartman." On that occasion Benedict XIII had exclaimed to his coachman: "Non ci far impicci"—"Do not involve us in a quarrel." On the other hand, this anonymous satirical comment on Benedict XIII's death was posted at the Pasquino:



"This tomb encloses
the bones of a little friar:
more than a saint's lover
a protector of brigands"

# Charles Bertie (died 1730)

Bertie died on 12 April 1730. He had four children:



Charles Bertie (13 February 1706/7 – 26 April 1784), married Bathsheba Mead, daughter of Richard Mead; had five sons and one daughter, Charles (d. 1780), Richard, James, Rev. Montague (1737–1778), Vere (d. 1747), and Bathsheba (d. 1749), all of whom died without issue

Peregrine Bertie (1709–1777), married Elizabeth Payne in 1736, had several children including Albemarle Bertie, 9th Earl of Lindsey
Susan Bertie, married Edward Hales, second son of Sir Edward Hales, 3rd Baronet


He was succeeded by his son Charles; he also left substantial legacies to his younger children.

# Thomas Bray

Thomas Bray died on 15 February and was buried two days later in the churchyard at St. Botolph's.

# Rushout Cullen

Cullen died on 15 October 1730, and was  buried at Upton. He had one daughter, Mary,  who married Sir John Dutton, 2nd Baronet but no male heir, so the baronetcy became extinct. He left as his heir his nephew Thomas Bedford of the Middle Temple.

# John Disney (priest)

Upon his death in 1729-30, he left a widow and eight children, five sons and three daughters. The entry for his death in the parish registers is followed by the abbreviation "Aff.". This was in accordance with the law passed in 1678, which demanded an affidavit that the bodies had been buried in woollen shrouds. His eldest son, John Disney of Lincoln, was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1733.

His writing mostly relating to the Societies for the Reformation of Manners was prolific, but he also found time to research and publish The Genealogy of the most Serene and Illustrious House of Brunswick-Lunenburgh, the present Royal Family of Great Britain in 1714.

# Joseph Earle (MP)

Earle died, aged 72, on 13 March 1730, and was buried at St. Werburgh’s church, Bristol. He and his wife had one daughter Eleanor, who married William Benson and died in 1722. He left his property at Bristol and Crudwell  to a younger brother, Robert. He left the remainder to his daughter’s son.

# John Evans (divine)

Evans died on 16 May 1730 from dropsy and a complication of other disorders. He was buried in Dr Williams's vault in Bunhill Fields burial ground.

# James Grahme

In September 1701 Grahme took the oaths to the government, and at the 1702 general election was elected M.P. for Appleby, Westmorland, where he was returned unopposed in 1705. On the death of his eldest son, Henry (1706–07), he succeeded him in the representation of Westmorland at the general election in 1708, and again at the elections of 1710, 1713, 1715, and 1722. At the 1727 general election he retired from public life.

His voting in 1710 in favour of Henry Sacheverell made Grahme popular in Westmorland and Cumberland. In 1717 he was elected mayor of Appleby by a large majority. In 1722 he was a deputy-lieutenant for Westmorland. For many years before his death Grahme had a house in Stratton Street, near Devonshire House, London. In the later part of his life he was often at Charlton, the Wiltshire seat of his son-in-law Lord Berkshire. He died there on 26 January 1730, and was buried there on 2 February. His epitaph in the church describes him as "servant to King Charles and King James the Second" and "faithful to both".

Horace Walpole wrote that Grahme was a fashionable man in his day, and noted for his dry humour. The manuscripts at Levens Hall belonging to Josceline Fitzroy Bagot were described in the Historical Manuscripts Commission's 10th Report. Grahme seems to have destroyed all letters from his brother, Lord Preston, and from his close friend Lord Sunderland. He kept only two letters from James II.

# Ashraf Hotak
When escaping from Persia, Ashraf was captured and murdered by Khan of Kalat Mir Mohabbat Khan Baloch in 1730. .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}
Ashraf, having taken Yazd and Kirmán, marched into Khurásán with an army of thirty thousand men to give battle to Ṭahmásp, but he was completely defeated by Nádir on October 2 at Dámghán. Another decisive battle was fought in the same year at Múrchakhúr near Iṣfahán. The Afgháns were again defeated and evacuated Iṣfahán to the number of twelve thousand men, but, before quitting the city he had ruined, Ashraf murdered the unfortunate ex-Shah Husayn, and carried off most of the ladies of the royal family and the King's treasure. When Ṭahmásp II entered Iṣfahán on December 9 he found only his old mother, who had escaped deportation by disguising herself as a servant, and was moved to tears at the desolation and desecration which met his eyes at every turn. Nádir, having finally induced Ṭahmásp to empower him to levy taxes on his own authority, marched southwards in pursuit of the retiring Afgháns, whom he overtook and again defeated near Persepolis. Ashraf fled from Shíráz towards his own country, but cold, hunger and the unrelenting hostility of the inhabitants of the regions which he had to traverse dissipated his forces and compelled him to abandon his captives and his treasure, and he was finally killed by a party of Balúch tribesmen.— Edward G. Browne, 1924



Ashraf Khan's death marked the end of Hotak rule in Persia, but the country of Afghanistan was still under Shah Hussain Hotak's control until Nader Shah's 1738 conquest of Kandahar where the young Ahmad Shah Durrani was held prisoner. It was only a short pause before the establishment of the last Afghan Empire (modern state of Afghanistan) by Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1747.
