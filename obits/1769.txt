# Peter Annet

At age 68, Annet was sentenced to the pillory and a year's hard labour. He died on 18 January 1769.

# Pârvu Cantacuzino

The Cantacuzinos' role in anti-Phanariote dissent was more evident from 1764, following the arrival of Grigore III Ghica on the throne in Bucharest. After the Russo-Turkish War began in October 1768, Pârvu and his brother formed a group of pro-Russian boyars in Bucharest. Their connection with the Russians was a Polkovnik Nazary Alexandrovych Karazin (father of Vasyl Karazin). While engaged in this conspiracy, Pârvu still enjoyed Ghica's trust, and, early in the war, was confirmed as Ban and Spatharios of the Wallachian army.

Karazin presented the Cantacuzinos with a manifesto by Catherine the Great, the Empress of All Russia, promising to free the Danubian Principalities and the Balkans from the "barbarians' domination". By then, the "Russian" party was also supported by burghers and commoners, who resented the Phanariote and Ottoman fiscal policies. These, alongside boyars who embraced the cause of "Holy Rus", numbered in the thousands—according to Djuvara, some 12,000 men from Wallachia and Moldavia migrated to Russia and joined the imperial army. In January 1769, with the Russians having taken Moldavia, the Orthodox Church of Wallachia sent a letter to the Empress, asking for their country to be occupied as well. At around that same date, Catherine wrote to Cantacuzino personally. Her reply referred to the Wallachians as a "Slavic people"—according to historian Nicolae Iorga and political scientist Dumitru Th. Pârvu, hers is the earliest record of Pan-Slavism being tested on the locals.

For several months, Karazin's mixed force did not venture out of Moldavia, and remained based at Focșani. Bucharest was pacified by the Ottomans during spring 1769, when the Ottoman army again set up a direct presence. Following its acts of violence against Bucharest civilians, and aware that the Turkish garrison was undermanned, Pârvu created his own volunteer army of Romanians and Arnavutlar (Albanians), joined by some of Karazin's Zaporozhian Cossacks; in the early hours of November 16, these troops ambushed the Ottomans and arrested Prince Grigore. Some 5,000 Ottoman soldiers were chased out of the capital, but only as far as Giurgiu, where they recuperated. Following this move, a group of Wallachian boyars addressed Catherine a letter in which they asked for Wallachia to be annexed as a guberniya.

Genealogist Eugène Rizo-Rangabé further notes that Pârvu was made the civilian "Governor of Wallachia" by General Pyotr Rumyantsev. Pârvu then appealed to his in-law, Ienăchiță Văcărescu, who was to obtain for him the submission of the Boyar Council. Văcărescu was dispatched to Buzău County, but used the opportunity to cross the border into neutral Transylvania; as he recalled in his memoirs, he felt pressured by Karazin, and would not commit themselves to the Cantacuzino's unreserved Russophilia. Reportedly, the Cantacuzinos hoped that Pârvu would take over Ghica's throne. This created additional frictions between the boyars, since Văcărescu wanted the throne for himself. 

A number of setbacks followed the early Russian victory. The Ottomans camped at Giurgiu began marching on Bucharest; Karazin's volunteers, sent to meet them, were defeated and had to barricade themselves in Comana Monastery. Placed in command of a small Russian detachment and a unit of Verzișori (Wallachian Jäger), Pârvu Cantacuzino promised to relieve them; he was ambushed by Ottoman troops in Vlăsiei forest, outside Comana. He was killed in battle alongside all his men, including a Russian Major by the name of Andreh and the Verzișori Captain Șerban Lăcusteanu. Some 1,000 soldiers are believed to have been killed on the anti-Ottoman side. 

However, the Comana ambush became a Russian tactical victory: the Ottoman soldiers, believing that they would not be able to confront a stream of Russian new arrivals, backed out of the confrontation and returned to Giurgiu. Pârvu's body was recovered by his followers and taken to the nearby monastery. Although the latter had been damaged during the fighting, it was incidentally a traditional Cantacuzino burial site. Pârvu's remains were placed in the tomb of his maternal ancestor, Radu Șerban.

# Henry Cary (Archdeacon of Killala)

In Henry's will, proved 1769,  he states that he had purchased a Lieutenancy of Foot for his son, William; an Ensigncy for Robert, with money paid out for a Lieutenancy of Foot for him also; and £300 to set up his son, Charles, as a Merchant in Dublin.  The will, which was witnessed by Peter Hamon, William Burrell, and Edward Geoghegan, also bestowed an annuity of ₤30 on Hector Hamon (possibly brother of Deborah's father, Isaac, and father of Peter, the witness to the will).  The house in Portarlington and a nearby farm at Westmeath were settled on his eldest son, Henry.

The seal on the Archdeacon's will was a swan rising, claiming a link to the Carys of Devon.  His father's seal had the episcopal arms of Killala and three roses on a bend, also arms of the Devon Carys.

At the time of the Archdeacon's death, Henry, jnr,  was 26, newly married to Anne Gore with a child of his own, and with the added responsibility of six younger siblings to care for, the youngest being only two years of age.  The second eldest son, William, was already away in the army.

# Pope Clement XIII

Clement XIII died during the night of 2 February 1769 in Rome of an apoplexy. He was laid to rest on 8 February 1769 in the Vatican but his remains were transferred on 27 September 1774 to a monument in the Vatican that had been sculpted by Antonio Canova at the request of Senator Abbondio Rezzonico, the nephew of the late pontiff.

From the Annual Register, for 1758:
Pope Clement XIII was "the honestest man in the world; a most exemplary ecclesiastic; of the purest morals; devout, steady, learned, diligent..."

# Alexander Drummond (consul)

He died at Edinburgh on 9 August 1769. A portrait of him is catalogued in Evans's 'Engraved Portraits'.

# Hakuin Ekaku

At the age of 83, Hakuin died in Hara, the same village in which he was born and which he had transformed into a center of Zen teaching.

# Ann Elliot

Elliot died after a long illness in a house in Greek Street in Soho that had been given to her by the Duke of Cumberland. Cumberland has the King's brother and she had been his mistress. She left thousands of pounds to her family including a contribution by the Duke. He arranged for her body to be buried and for a memorial to be created that includes lines attributed to Arthur Murphy.

After her death an anonymous biography appeared of her life noting how Arthur Murphy was devoted to her and how he missed her after his death. After Arthur Murphy's death this relationship was written about by Fanny Burney who found Murphy's devotion to Eliot fascinating.

# Nawab Fazl Ali Khan III Bahadur

He died of smallpox on 7 April 1769 and was succeeded by his nephew, Sayyid Husain Ali Khan Bahadur

# Francisco Xavier de Mendonça Furtado

Mendonça Furtado died suddenly on 15 November 1769 when the court was at the Braganza family's Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa. 


Reasons for his death are unclear. In the editor's footnote to the Anecdotes du ministère de Sébastien-Joseph Carvalho the following is given:
By contrast, the Mémoires du Sébastien-Joseph Carvalho e Melo vary on this point, saying that Carvalho e Melo had allowed himself to take the young Prince of Beira to spend a few days at Oeiras while the court was at Vila Viçosa; that Queen Mariana Victoria, so distressed by this audacity, that having met his brother Mendonça Furtado, "crushed him with the harshest reproaches,  And made him bear all the weight of her resentment. Mendonça in despair, retired to his apartment, where he was seized with a fever so violent, that it took him away after three days."

Neither story can be verified from independent first-hand reports, and both have elements that sound fanciful. Considering that the first is attributed to a "champion of the Jesuit society" (Portuguese: paladino da sociedade jesuitica), which could have been the queen or a number of other members of the nobility and aristocracy who were strongly critical of what Carvalho e Melo and his brother had carried against the Jesuits, references to phenomena such as foul body odours or the queen's rage being enough to kill a man could be read as attempts to pour scorn on the two brothers.

As indicated above, Mendonça Furtado had to be buried quickly. This took place on the same day of his death and his tomb is located in the Capela do Sanctíssimo Sacramento (Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament) to the left of High Altar of the Igreja Matriz de Vila Viçosa (Mother Church of Vila Viçosa, ie the Santuário de Nossa Sra. da Conceição). Due to restoration work carried out in 1940, his tombstone and those of others buried there were removed and their bones were placed together in a wooden box and deposited in an unmarked site.

# Samuel Grove

Grove died on 18 or 19 February 1769. His will is available from the British National Archives. Grove was succeeded as rector by Benjamin Underwood.

# Robert Sawyer Herbert

Herbert died on 25 April 1769. His brothers  Hon. Nicholas, Thomas and William Herbert were also MPs. He left Highclere to his nephew Henry Herbert, son of his brother William.

# Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet

Moore died suddenly while in office at New York City in 1769.  The duties of governor then fell on Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden, whose term was much less peaceful.  Moore left with the respect of almost all the colony's leadership, the only exception being certain religious fundamentalists angered by his efforts to create a theatre or playhouse.

He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his thirteen-year-old son John Henry Moore, 2nd Baronet, who died in 1780 aged 23.

# William Pitkin

Pitkin died in East Hartford on October 1, 1769, while serving as governor, and is interred there at Center Cemetery. He is commemorated by that town's Governor William Pitkin School.

# William Powell (English actor)

On 31 May 1769 Powell made, as Jaffier, his last appearance on the stage, in Bristol at the King Street Theatre. The following day he caught cold, playing cricket. His illness became severe, and King Street, in which, near the theatre, he lived, was barred by chains against carriages, by order of the magistrates. On Friday, at the request of his family and physician, the performances were suspended to avoid disturbing him, and on Monday, 3 July, at seven in the morning, he died. ‘Richard III’ was given that evening, and Holland, then manager, had to apologise for the inability of the actors to play their parts. The audience voluntarily dispensed with the closing farce.

Powell was buried on the following Thursday in Bristol Cathedral, Colman, Holland, and Clarke, with all the performers of the theatre, attending the funeral, which was conducted by the dean. An anthem was sung by the choir. On 14 July the Roman Father was performed in Bristol for the benefit of Powell's family, most of the audience appearing in black. An address by Colman was spoken by Holland, who did not long survive. A monument in the north aisle of the cathedral, erected by his widow, has an epitaph, also by Colman.

# Christian Jacob Protten

Christian Jacob Protten died in 1769 in Christiansborg, Accra, leaving his wife, Rebecca, widowed for a second time. She had not fully acclimatised to the Gold Coast and the Moravian missionaries contemplated sending her back to Saint Thomas. As she was in poor health, it was decided she remained on the Gold Coast, where she eventually died in 1780, aged 62 years. The appendix to Protten’s booklet was the first published grammar of an indigenous language of the Gold Coast. His linguistic work in the Ga language predated that of the German philologist and Basel missionary, Johannes Zimmermann (1825–1876) by a century. Zimmerman also translated the entire Bible into the Ga language. In effect, his grammatical output was an example for both Zimmermann and the Basel Mission pastor and historian, Carl Christian Reindorf (1834–1917), whose literary masterpiece, The History of the Gold Coast and Asante was written in the Ga and English languages and published in 1895 in Basel. Moreover, as a mulatto or an Atlantic Creole, Protten was able to hone his linguistic talents and abilities by blending his African upbringing and his European education, through a spatial awareness of the missionary settings he lived in during the 1700s.

# Owen Ruffhead

His close application to his later literary works, in addition to his legal duties, undermined his health, and a cold taken in a heated court resulted in his premature death on 25 October 1769. A few days before his death, in recognition of his political services, he had received an offer of a secretaryship in the treasury. He left one son, Thomas, who died a curate of Prittlewell in Essex in 1798. The publishers recovered from him a sum advanced to his father on account of Chambers' Cyclopædia the supervision of which was transferred in 1773 to John Calder.

# Bartolomé Rull

Bishop Rull died on February 19, 1769 at the age of 77 after 10 years as bishop of Malta.

# John White (1699–1769)

White died unmarried on 7 September 1769. He was succeeded by his younger brother Taylor White.
