Spencer—along with clerics from Stoke, Wolstanton, and Newcastle-under-Lyme—exhumed her body, opened the coffin, and threw in the still-living blackbird that had been her companion.

By the time of his death, Palladianism had been taken up by a whole new generation of British architects working in the classical forms, and was to remain in fashion until it was replaced by the Neoclassical interpretations of such architects as Robert Adam.

His final intended publication, which would have added to an evaluation of his work "Treatise of Architecture and ye Art of Building Publick and Private Edifices—Containing Several Noblemen's Houses & Country Seats’ was to have been a book of his own designs and interpretations.

# Kanakaraya Mudali

On 22 October 1739, his only son Velavendra Mudali (birth: 12 September 1718) died at age of 21. Even though the circumstances and the cause of death are not recorded, Ananda Ranga pillai being a well versed astrologist, suggests in his diary that this is due to a bad turn in Kanagaraya Mudaliyar's astrology. He also records that Velavendra was buried the next day at 3:00 PM with silk attire and pearl earrings and ring to his finger.

Kanagaraya was very much disturbed as his son was very helpful to him in all aspects. When they returned from the cemetery, Ananda Ranga pillai records that Kanagaraya's wife's sari was set ablaze in an accident and one his Kanagaraya's house was destroyed in fire costing him around 100 varagans. All of this are considered by Ananda Ranga pillai as astrological misfortunes.

# James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth

Several of the Rising's participants, including Elcho and Perth, were able to escape on one of the French ships that landed at Borrodale on May 3. Perth had always been said to have had a delicate constitution following a childhood accident; the campaign had taken a high physical toll on the participants and some accounts suggest that by this point he was unwell and was being carried by retainers. John Daniel later recalled seeing Perth waiting on the shore "wrapped up in a blanket"; he told Daniel "if we are so fortunate to get to France, depend upon it, then I shall always be your friend". During the voyage to France there was an epidemic of fever on the ships and Perth, on board the Bellone, was among those who died, on 13 May: as the ships were not able to reach the coast, he was buried at sea. 

In a period when the Jacobite sympathies of many were the result of a complex mixture of political, religious, familial and other local factors, Perth's motivation appeared relatively straightforward to contemporaries: recording his death, Elcho wrote that "he was a very brave and gallant man and entirely devoted to the House of Stuart". Perth had no children, and his younger brother John inherited the claim to the ducal title.

# Philip V of Spain

Philip was afflicted by fits of manic depression and increasingly fell victim to a deep melancholia. His second wife, Elizabeth Farnese, completely dominated her passive husband. She bore him further sons, including another successor, Charles III of Spain. Beginning in August 1737 his affliction was eased by the castrato singer Farinelli, who, became the "Musico de Camara of Their Majesties." Farinelli would sing eight or nine arias for the king and queen every night, usually with a trio of musicians.

Philip died on 9 July 1746 in El Escorial, in Madrid, but was buried in his favorite Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, near Segovia. Ferdinand VI of Spain, his son by his first queen Maria Luisa of Savoy, succeeded him.[citation needed]

# Robert Pigott

Pigott died in December 1746, leaving five sons and two surviving daughters  and was buried at Chetwynd. He left estates in five counties – Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Northamptonshire, Shropshire and Warwickshire – and  a personal wealth of  well over £17,000. His eldest son, appears to have been a High Tory and contested Shrewsbury unsuccessfully on the Tory interest in 1747. It was said that he visited the Pretender in Rome in 1720, and came away with a portrait.  The estates descended in the main line and were sold by his grandson and namesake, Robert Pigott a radical in politics and manners, who went to live in France.

# William Tennent

Tennent died in Warminster in 1746, and his gravesite can still be found today in the church cemetery of the Neshaminy-Warwick Presbyterian Church.  Tennent's last will and testament is on record at the Bucks County Court House. It indicates that by the time he died he was still an humble servant of God, leaving what little he had to his wife Catherine (née Kennedy) Tennent. However, Tennent was also a slave owner; as his will indicates, he left "three Negroes" to his wife.

With the help of the Mohawk, Weiser led a group of Germans from Schoharie south to the Susquehanna River; they traveled along Indian paths and by canoe to present-day Tulpehocken in the spring of 1723.
