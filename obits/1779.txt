# Vicente Álvarez Travieso

In 1785, the Mulas was obtained by Thomas, one of the sons of Vicente Alvarez Travieso. However, other people, who were also heirs of this land, questioned the rights of Thomas to inherit the land. In 1809, the ranch was transferred to Vicente, the son of Thomas.

# Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet

In late 1771 Bernard was bequeathed the manor at Nether Winchendon upon the death of a cousin to whom he had been close since childhood.  Combined with other uncertainties about where various family members would reside after he received the Irish appointment, the stress of the situation led Bernard to suffer a stroke.  His mobility was impaired, but he took the waters at Bath, which appear to have helped his recovery.  He applied for permission to resign the Irish post, and settled first at the Nether Winchendon manor; in 1774 his resignation was accepted and his pension restored.  He was well enough in 1772 to travel to Oxford, where he received an honorary Doctor of Civil Law from his alma mater, Christ Church.  Because of his health he moved later in 1772 to a smaller house in nearby Aylesbury.  He died on 16 June 1779, after an epileptic seizure, at Nether Winchendon; his grave is in St Mary's churchyard, Aylesbury.

# Joseph Bowman

In celebration, of the end, of General Clark's Illinois campaign, a six-pounder cannon was fired on February 25, 1779.  During the cannon salute, some of the artillery gunpowder charges accidentally ignited, wounding Captain Edward Worthington, four privates, a captured British soldier, and critically wounding Captain Bowman.  Oddly enough, General Clark made no mention of the tragic cannon accident in his memoir.  However, Clark does describe Major Bowman leading soldiers, as late as June 1779.  Due to the severe burn wounds he received, the health of Major Bowman deteriorated, causing him to die, at Fort Patrick Henry, on August 14, 1779.  The last page of his journal is blank, except for an anonymous notation: "God save the [Virginia] commonwealth, this 15th day of August, 1779."  A bronze grave marker with the date of August 18, 1779 was later, placed in the St. Francis Xavier Cemetery, adjacent to the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park, Vincennes, Knox County, Indiana, though he was buried somewhere along the Wabash River.

# James Cook

After a month's stay, Cook attempted to resume his exploration of the northern Pacific. Shortly after leaving Hawaii Island, however, Resolution's foremast broke, so the ships returned to Kealakekua Bay for repairs.

Tensions rose, and a number of quarrels broke out between the Europeans and Hawaiians at Kealakekua Bay. An unknown group of Hawaiians took one of Cook's small boats. The evening when the cutter was taken, the people had become "insolent" even with threats to fire upon them. Cook attempted to kidnap and ransom the King of Hawaiʻi, Kalaniʻōpuʻu.

The following day, 14 February 1779, Cook marched through the village to retrieve the king. Cook took the king (aliʻi nui) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favourite wives, Kanekapolei, and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go. An old kahuna (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The king began to understand that Cook was his enemy. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on his face in the surf. He was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named Kalaimanokahoʻowaha or Kanaʻina (namesake of Charles Kana'ina) and then stabbed by one of the king's attendants, Nuaa. The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two others were wounded in the confrontation.

# George Farmer (Royal Navy officer)

On returning to England after an uneventful commission, Farmer was appointed in March 1778 to the 32-gun HMS Quebec, in which he was employed during the year in convoy service in the North Sea. In 1779 he was stationed chiefly at Guernsey as a guard for the Channel Islands, and to gain intelligence. It was thus that as early as 18 June he sent over news that the French fleet had sailed from Brest, that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Cadiz, and that there were at Le Havre great preparations for an invading force. 

On 6 July he wrote that he had driven on shore and destroyed a convoy of forty-nine small vessels, with a 20-gun frigate and several armed vessels; but that Quebec herself had struck heavily on the rocks, and he had been obliged to throw his guns overboard. This necessitated his going to Portsmouth for repairs, and when these were finished, as there were no 12-pounders to replace the lost guns, he had to be supplied with 9-pounders, which were taken from another frigate not ready for sea. 

With this reduced armament, off Ushant, on 6 October, Quebec met the French 32-gun 12-pounder frigate Surveillante, carrying nearly double the number of men. A sharp action ensued; after about three hours and a half both ships were dismasted; but Quebec's sails that had fallen over the guns caught fire, and the frigate was speedily in a blaze. There was little wind and a great swell; Surveillante, completely disabled, was at some little distance; the cutter HMS Rambler was to leeward, and also dismasted; and the French cutter L'Expédition, which had been engaged with Rambler, had sought safety in flight. It was thus impossible to help the burning frigate, which after some four or five hours blew up. Sixty-six only out of about 195 that were on board were picked up by the boats of Surveillante, of Rambler, and of a Russian vessel that came on the scene; the rest, including Captain Farmer, perished.

# David Garrick

Shortly before his death he worked on the production of The Camp with Sheridan at Drury Lane and caught a very bad cold. The Camp was based around the British response to a threatened invasion by France, leading some to jokingly claim that Garrick was the only casualty of the ultimately abandoned invasion.

He died less than three years after his retirement, at his house in Adelphi Buildings, London, and was interred in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. Mrs. Garrick survived her husband by 43 years.

# John Glynn

Glynn was married on 21 July 1763 to Susanna Margaret, third daughter of Sir John Oglander of Nunwell in the Isle of Wight. She had been born on 1 September 1744 and died at Catherine Place, Bath, on 20 May 1816. They had three sons and a daughter.

Glynn suffered from gout and had to be carried into the House in April 1769 to vote against the motion for seating Henry Luttrell for Middlesex. In 1778 a deputy was allowed on account of his illness to act for him as recorder. On 16 September 1779 he died, and was buried at Cardinham on 23 September.

# Emperor Go-Momozono

Go-Momozono's Imperial Family lived with him in the Dairi of the Heian Palace, he never officially married and only had children with a court lady named Konoe Koreko (近衛維子). This family included at least 2 sons who died in infancy, and one 10-month-old daughter at the time of the Emperor's early death. Emperor Go-Momozono became ill in 1779, but his daughter was not eligible to become empress due to her age. When it became clear that the Emperor would not survive, his aunt former Empress Go-Sakuramachi had him adopt a son on his deathbed. The adopted son was from the Kan'in branch of the Imperial family, and would become the next Emperor. Go-Momozono died on December 16, 1779 at the age of 21 and his adopted son Prince Morohito became Emperor Kōkaku in the following year. Go-Momozono's only daughter Princess Yoshiko would later become Kōkaku's chief wife (chūgū).

Go-Momozono's kami is enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, Tsuki no wa no misasagi, at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto.  Also enshrined in this location are this Emperor's immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono and Go-Sakuramachi. The shrine complex also encompasses the misasagi of three of Go-Momozono's immediate successors – Kōkaku, Ninkō, and Kōmei.

# John Hart (New Jersey politician)

On November 7, 1778, John Hart returned to Hopewell from the Assembly in Trenton.  Two days later, he indicated that he was too ill with "gravel" (kidney stones) to return.  He continued to suffer from the painful affliction for more than six months until his death on May 11, 1779, at the age of 65.

The following obituary for John Hart appeared on May 19, 1779:

# Kalaimanokahoʻowaha

Cook's men and the British Marines were confronted on the beach by an elderly kahuna who approached them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away but he kept approaching them while singing the mele. When Cook and his men looked away from the old kahuna, the beach was now swarmed by thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook yelled at Kalaniʻōpuʻu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began to back away from the crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and Kānekapōlei shielded the aliʻi nui as Cook tried to force him to his feet. The crowd was now very hostile. Kanaʻina approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted the man. Some accounts state that Kanaʻina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief struck the navigator across the head with his leiomano. Either way, Kanaʻina released Cook where he fell to the ground. As Cook tried to get up, the attendant Nuaa stabbed Captain Cook with a metal dagger.

The Marines fired as they fled, killing a number of Native Hawaiians including Kanaʻina and his brothers. They got into the boats and fled back to the ship where, with a spyglass, a young William Bligh (the future captain of HMS Bounty) watched as Cook's body was dragged up the hill to the town where it was torn into pieces in full view of his ship's crew.

# George Kellie

Kellie went on to achieve local distinction in his lifetime. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in December 1823. In 1827 he was elected President of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society and was succeeded in that office by John Abercrombie.
George Kellie collapsed and died in Leith on 28 September 1829 while on his way home from visiting a patient.

# William Kenrick (writer)

According to the General Biographical Dictionary of 1815 in Kenrick's later years he drank very heavily, a habit which probably caused his relatively early death: 

Indeed, Kenrick wrote revealingly of himself that he drank spirits (aqua vitae), to pen acid (aqua fortis):

# Anton Raphael Mengs

In 1749 Anton Raphael Mengs was appointed first painter to Frederick Augustus, elector of Saxony, but this did not prevent him from continuing to spend much of his time in Rome. There he married Margarita Guazzi, who had sat for him as a model in 1748. He converted to Catholicism, and in 1754 he became director of the Vatican painting school. His fresco painting Parnassus at Villa Albani gained him a reputation as a master painter.

In 1749 Mengs accepted a commission from the Duke of Northumberland to make a copy, in oil on canvas, of Raphael's fresco The School of Athens for his London home. Executed in 1752–5, Mengs's painting is full-sized, but he adapted the composition to a rectangular format and added other figures. It is now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. 

Mengs died in Rome in June 1779 and was buried there in the Church of Santi Michele e Magno.

# George Gabriel Powell

George Gabriel Powell died in January 1779. He was a flawed character, seen by some as a patriot and others as a schemer. Alexander Gregg, the Cheraws district historian and a local bishop, eulogized him as follows. 

If Gregg had been aware of Powell’s disgrace as the acting Governor of St Helena, and the brutal treatment of the slaves, who worked on his plantations, his obituary might not have been so positive.

# Casimir Pulaski

While attempting to rally fleeing French forces during a cavalry charge, Pulaski was mortally wounded by grapeshot. The reported grapeshot is on display at the Georgia Historical Society in Savannah. The Charleston Museum also has a grapeshot reported to be from Pulaski's wound. Pulaski was carried from the field of battle and taken aboard the South Carolina merchant brig privateer Wasp, under the command of Captain Samuel Bulfinch, where he died two days later, having never regained consciousness. His heroic death, admired by American Patriot supporters, further boosted his reputation in America.

The historical accounts for Pulaski's time and place of burial vary considerably. According to several contemporary accounts there were witnesses, including Pulaski's aide-de-camp, that Pulaski received a symbolic burial in Charleston on October 21, sometime after he was buried at sea. Other witnesses, including Captain Samuel Bulfinch of the Wasp, however, claimed that the wounded Pulaski was actually later removed from the ship and taken to the Greenwich plantation in the town of Thunderbolt, near Savannah, where he died and was buried.

In March 1825, during his grand tour of the United States, Lafayette personally laid the cornerstone for the Casimir Pulaski Monument in Savannah, Georgia.

# Alexander Purdie (publisher)

Purdie suffered from dropsy in his later years. He died at Williamsburg in 1779.

# Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple

Earl Temple died early in September 1779, aged 67, after a fall from his phaeton.  The only issue of his marriage being a daughter who died in infancy, Temple was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew George Nugent-Temple-Grenville.

# John Rolle Walter

He died unmarried and childless and  his heir was his next younger brother Denys Rolle (1725–1797), the father of John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (1750–1842), which peerage had been created a second time for him.

# William Warburton

Warburton died at Gloucester on 7 June 1779.  He left no children, his only son having predeceased him. In 1781 his widow, Gertrude, married the Rev. Martin Stafford Smith.
