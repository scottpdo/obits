# Anne, Queen of Great Britain

Anne was devastated by her husband's death in October 1708, and the event proved a turning point in her relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough. The Duchess arrived at Kensington Palace shortly before George died, and after his death insisted that Anne leave Kensington for St James's Palace against her wishes. Anne resented the Duchess's intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural "to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead".

The Whigs used George's death to their own advantage. The leadership of the Admiralty was unpopular among the Whig leaders, who had blamed Prince George and his deputy George Churchill (who was Marlborough's brother) for mismanagement of the navy. With Whigs now dominant in Parliament, and Anne distraught at the loss of her husband, they forced her to accept the Junto leaders Lords Somers and Wharton into the cabinet. Anne, however, insisted on carrying out the duties of Lord High Admiral herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of the Earl of Orford, another member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Anne appointed the moderate Earl of Pembroke, on 29 November 1708. Pressure mounted on Pembroke, Godolphin and the Queen from the dissatisfied Junto Whigs, and Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.

Sarah continued to berate Anne for her friendship with Abigail, and in October 1709, Anne wrote to the Duke of Marlborough asking that his wife "leave off teasing & tormenting me & behave herself with the decency she ought both to her friend and Queen". On Maundy Thursday 6 April 1710, Anne and Sarah saw each other for the last time. According to Sarah, the Queen was taciturn and formal, repeating the same phrases—"Whatever you have to say you may put in writing" and "You said you desired no answer, and I shall give you none"—over and over.

# Constantin Brâncoveanu

The circumstances and facts of Constantin's death are recorded in history, and his santification is recognized by all The Eastern Orthodox Churches.

Dragoș Ungureanu, a specialist at the National Patrimony Institute, makes "a clear distinction between the holiness status of Prince Brâncoveanu and the same quality of some European monarchs who haven't suffered a martyr's death. Brâncoveanu was canonised for his and his sons' martyrdom, just like the martyrdom of Christians in ancient Rome, killed for their faith in Christ. And just like other Christian martyrs, Brâncoveanu had to choose between his and his sons' death, and their conversion to Islam."

On 15 August 1714, the Feast of the Dormition, when Constantin Brâncoveanu was also celebrating his 60th birthday, he and his four sons and his advisor Ianache were brought before Sultan Ahmed III of Turkey. Diplomatic representatives of Austria, Russia, France and England were also present. After all of his fortune has been seized, in exchange for the life of his family he was asked to renounce the Orthodox Christian faith. He reportedly said: ″Behold, all my fortunes and all I had, I have lost! Let us not lose our souls. Be brave and manly, my beloved! Ignore death. Look at how much Christ, our Savior, has endured for us and with what shameful death he died. Firmly believe in this and do not move, nor leave your faith for this life and this world.″ After this, his four sons, Constantin, Ștefan, Radu and Matei and advisor Ianache were beheaded in front of their father.

History also that the smallest child, Matei (12 years old) was so frightened after seeing the bloodbath and the heads of his three brothers that he started crying and asking his father to let him renounce Christianity and convert to Islam as the Sultan Ahmed III had demanded. At that moment, Constantin Brâncoveanu said: "Of our kind none have lost their faith. It is better to die a thousand times than to leave your ancient faith just to live few more years on earth." Matei listened and offered his head. After Brâncoveanu himself was decapitated, their heads were impaled on javelins and displayed in a procession. Their bodies were left before the gate and later on thrown into the waters of the Bosphorus.

# Samuel Carpenter

Samuel Carpenter died at the house of his son-in-law, William Fishbourn, at Sepviva plantation (380 acres are now part of "Fair Hill"), Philadelphia, on 10 April 1714.

His friend James Logan wrote in a letter dated "2 mo. 11th, 1714" (now known as 11 April 1714) to William Penn: "We have now lost our dear friend, Samuel Carpenter. He departed last night about 11, at his daughter Fishbourn's where he lodged when taken ill. He lay about twelve days ill of a violent rheumatism and fever, in great pain, but just before his departure he took leave of all his friends about him and went quietly away." "And further, of his honour, integrity and the high estimation in which he was held ... sincere honesty and public spirit ..." "He was universally beloved and esteemed here as I always loved him and his generous disposition."

The Friends meeting, after his death, said of him: "He was a pattern of humility, patience and self denial; a man fearing God and hating covetousness, much given to hospitality and good work. He was a loving affectionate husband, tender father and a faithful friend and brother."

Samuel Carpenter was laid to rest at the Society of Friends (Quakers) Burial Ground at Fourth and Arch Streets in Philadelphia the day after James Logan's letter dated "2 mo. 11th, 1714."

Samuel Carpenter, the immigrant, left numerous posterity, many of whom became distinguished in the affairs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Providence, Rhode Island. Many leading families of Philadelphia (DuPont, Lloyd, Preston, Story, Wharton, Wright and others) can trace their ancestry back to Samuel Carpenter.

# Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)

In 1712, Berry's eldest brother, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Dauphin of France, and the latter's elder son, Louis, Duke of Brittany died. It was foreseeable that Berry would serve as Regent for his brother's younger son, Louis, Duke of Anjou. But, on 5 May 1714, he died from internal injuries sustained in a hunting accident. His death rendered the details of the Regency less straightforward than before.

# Sarah Fell

Fell died on June 9, 1714 in Gooseyes, Essex, England.

# Elizabeth Freke

Elizabeth Freke had a somewhat rocky relationship with her husband as he financially drained her of her resources,  although she had increasingly used what she had and began to be involved with the church of  St. Cecilia as she spent personal time and money for its repair. As she grew more involved, she began to assert her dominance on the church as she felt she had gained the control from her financial contributions. On 14 February 1713 the Bishop of Norwich instructed the vicar of Gayton to bar her from the church entirely.

In reference to her death, Elizabeth Freke had initially wanted to be buried next to her husband in the vault she had supported. As a result of her banishment from the church, she was not permitted to do such a thing due to the altercation. She evidently is currently buried in Westminster Abbey when she died in 1714 at age 69.

# Baptist Noel, 3rd Earl of Gainsborough

The earl died of smallpox, aged 29, on 17 April 1714, and was succeeded by his eldest son.

# Charles Godfrey (courtier)

Godfrey died on 23 February 1714 while on a visit to Bath, Somerset and was buried in Bath Abbey. He and his wife had a son and two daughters. His son Francis predeceased him in 1712. His daughter Elizabeth  married Edmund Dunch MP (1677–1719) and Charlotte  married Hugh Boscawen, 1st Viscount Falmouth (1675–1734).

# Matthew Henry

Two years later, on 22 June 1714, he died suddenly of apoplexy at the Queen's Aid House (41 High Street) in Nantwich, while on a journey from Chester to London.

# Philipp von Hörnigk

# Timothy Jollie

He died on Easter day, 28 March 1714, and was buried on 31 March in the graveyard at the Upper Chapel, where his tombstone bears a Latin inscription, which gives his age ‘ætatis suæ 56.’ His funeral sermon was preached by his assistant, John de la Rose. 

He married Elizabeth (d 20 Jan. 1709), daughter of James Fisher (d 1666), the ejected vicar of Sheffield, with whom he had two sons, Thomas and Timothy, both of whom became independent ministers.

# Anna Mons

After Peter divorced Lopukhina, Anna had ambitions of marrying Peter herself, but by 1703 she feared he had lost interest in her and she took up a flirtation with the Prussian ambassador Keyserling in an effort to rekindle Peter's affections. Keyserling proposed marriage, provoking Peter to have Anna expelled from her estate and placed under house arrest along with her mother, sister and thirty friends. Peter later allowed the two of them to marry, which they did in 1711. Anna died three years later of consumption.

# Bernardino Ramazzini

Ramazzini died in Padua on 5 November 1714.

# Aleksander Benedykt Sobieski

In 1710 he settled in Rome. Still in 1709, under the pseudonym Armonte Calidio, he joined the Roman academy Arcadia and the congregation of writers, artists and scholars. During the meetings held in the Arcadian Roman Mansion he often recited his own poetry written in Latin. Aleksander throughout his life was passionate about theater. He created his own version of the Arcadian dramma nobile. In the years 1710-1713 he completed the composition of several operas, in collaboration with the composer Domenico Scarlattim and set designer Filippo Juvarra. Occasionally, he starred in his plays.

A ship from Gdańsk, Printz Alexander von Pohlen, was named after him.

Sobieski died young in 1714 and was buried in the Roman Capuchin Crypt.

# Sophia of Hanover

Although considerably older than Queen Anne, Sophia enjoyed much better health. According to the Countess of Bückeburg in a letter to Sophia's niece, the Raugravine Luise, on 5 June 1714 Sophia felt ill after receiving an angry letter from Queen Anne. Two days later she was walking in the gardens of Herrenhausen when she ran to shelter from a sudden downpour of rain and collapsed and died, aged 83—a very advanced age for the era. Just over a month later, in August, Queen Anne died at the age of 49. Had Anne predeceased Sophia, Sophia would have been the oldest person to ascend the British throne.

Upon Sophia's death, her eldest son Elector George Louis of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1660–1727) became heir presumptive in her place, and weeks later, succeeded Anne as George I. Sophia's daughter Sophia Charlotte of Hanover (1668–1705) married Frederick I of Prussia, from whom the later Prussian and German monarchs descend.

Sophia was buried in the chapel of Leine Palace, as were her husband and, later, their son George I. After destruction of the palace and its chapel during World War II by British air raids, their remains were moved into the mausoleum of King Ernest Augustus I in the Berggarten of Herrenhausen Gardens in 1957.
