Muhammad Sharif (Kalifa)



After the Battle of Omdurman (2 September 1898) in which the Mahdist forces were defeated by an Anglo-Egyptian force led by General Herbert Kitchener, Khalifa Sherif surrendered to the British.
Muhammad Sharif was placed under house arrest in the village of Shakaba near Wad Madani with two of the Mahdi's sons.
In 1899, hearing that they planned to join the Khalifa (who was still at large), the three were arrested.
There was a skirmish when an attempt was made to rescue them. Sherif and the Mahdi's two sons were found guilty by a court martial trial and were shot.
A different version of what happened is that the government heard a rumor that the group was conducting Mahdist propaganda. A force of government troops was dispatched which fired on the group at random, killing Khalifa Muhammad Sharif and two of the Mahdi's sons, al-Fadil and al-Bushra. A third son, Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, was badly wounded.

One of Muhammad Sharif's wives was the Sharifa Zainab bint al-Mahdi, daughter of the Mahdi, and their son Husain al-Khalifa Muhammad Sharif (1888â€“1928) was a pioneer journalist in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
