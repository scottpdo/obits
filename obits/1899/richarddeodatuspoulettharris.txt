Richard Deodatus Poulett-Harris



He died at Woodbridge, Tasmania, on 23 December 1899, and was survived by his wife, and of his first marriage: Georgiana (see above); Katharine (1847–1940); Charlotte Maria (1850–1941); Annie Louisa (1853–1922), and Lovell Andrews (1856–1929); and of his second marriage: Eleanor Mary (1865–1931), Henry Vere (1866–1933), Anna May (1869–1953), and Louisa Violet (b. 1873). Louisa's younger twin, Harriet Lily, died from Tubercular Peritonitis in 1897, aged 23, having been a teacher at the Ladies' Grammar School and Kindergarten in Davey Street, Hobart that was run by her sisters.  She is now regarded as the founder of women's cricket in Australia.  A memorial for her exists in the All Saints' Anglican Church in Macquarie Street, South Hobart.

Richard and his daughters Eleanor and Lily are buried in the same grave at Cornelian Bay Cemetery.
