Frank R. Day



Day committed suicide in June 1899 when he sealed his room in the Van Dyke lodging house at 330 McAllister Street, San Francisco, and turned on all the gas jets. He left a note stating: "If my body is found, tell my friends at Wells, Fargo & Co. to bury me at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland. My father, Loth [sic] Day, and mother, Celine Day, are buried there."

Of him, the San Francisco Call said:



" Having run through two moderate fortunes, having become divorced from two wives by reason of his dissipated habits, . . . Frank R. Day . . . ended his life with the hand of a suicide. . . . Day was a clever man, of good education, a pleasing address and a faculty for making friends. When not under the influence of liquor he was a charming companion and numbered among his friends many persons of considerable influence. . . . By the death of his father Day inherited considerable property, . . . but he ran through it in a short time..
