Ferdinand de Béhagle



In 1898 Émile Gentil had been given command of a new French mission to oppose Rabih in Bagirmi.
Henri Bretonnet was sent ahead with an advance party to rescue de Béhagle, and was met by Rabih on the Chari.
The battle of Togbao took place on 17 July 1899 on the banks of the Chari about 100 kilometres (62 mi) north of Fort Archambault (Sarh).
Bretonnet and most of his men were killed.
Rabih ordered the execution of de Béhagle on 15 October 1899.[c]
De Béhagle was hung and his body was thrown in a pit.
The incident made war between France and Rabih inevitable.

De Béhagle's body was recovered in 1901 by troops of colonel Georges Destenave, and buried at Fort Lamy (N'Djamena).
The rue Ferdinand-de-Béhagle was opened in Paris in 1932 in the 12th arrondissement near the Museum of African and Oceanic Arts, and was named after the explorer on 3 February 1936.
