Agnes Cotton



Cotton died in Leytonstone on 20 May 1899 at The Pastures, and was buried with her family in St. John's Churchyard on 24 May. Cotton left monies for women who had assisted her, including Elizabeth Amelia Bragg, and her ward, Mary Agnes Hope.

Cotton's home continued to operate until the Second World War under the management of the Community of St. John Baptist, Clewer. In 1940 the home was evacuated to Northampton, and after the war it was never reopened.
