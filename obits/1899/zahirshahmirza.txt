Zahir Shah Mirza



In the early 1870s, in neighboring estates in Natore, he provided support to the local governors and zamindars in crushing the Pabna revolts by the peasantry. In Pabna, he was a patron and participant in the Chalanbeel Horse Races. After his death in 1899, the estates of the family was expanded by his son and grandsons to become one of the few Muslim zamindars in the area. After the abolition of the lord-peasant system in 1950, members of the family held important positions in the regional politics and local governance.

His son Mirza Zafar succeeded him as the Zamindar. His office of the Mridha went to younger sons who dominated politics in Rajshahi and Natore well into the twenty first century, such as Ibrahim Ali Mridha and others.
