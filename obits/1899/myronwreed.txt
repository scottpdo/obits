Myron W. Reed



Reed was stricken with fatal illness late in January 1899, lapsing into unconsciousness during his final hours. He died at 4:55 am on January 30 in Denver, with physicians listing the cause of death as chronic entero colitis inflammation. Reed was 62 years old at the time of his death.

The memorial service which followed was pointedly addressed by a representative of the three main religious tendencies of Colorado, led by the rabbi W. S. Friedman, the Roman Catholic priest William O'Ryan, and the Protestant minister Barton Aylesworth and addressed by several secular speakers. The Grand Army of the Republic and Masons, two organizations with which Reed was actively involved, were also made part of the proceedings. A committee of six state senators were appointed by Governor Charles S. Thomas, who also paved the way for Reed's body to lie in state in a closed casket at the Colorado State Capitol prior to internment.

Reed was survived by his wife and three children.
