Jennie Worrell



Worrell died in 1899 at the Kings County Hospital of burns she sustained while sleeping on the grass meadows at the foot of 17th Street, in Coney Island. She lived there destitute, having resided in Coney Island for some years after divorcing Murray. Police of the precinct had arrested her a number of times. Her sisters separated themselves from her years before
because of her degenerate lifestyle.

The New York Times reported that she was to be buried in Potter's Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, unless someone claimed her body.
