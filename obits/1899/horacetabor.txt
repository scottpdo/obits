Horace Tabor



Tabor ran without success for governor of Colorado governor in 1884, 1886, and 1888. Then, in 1893, the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in the administration of President Grover Cleveland, devastated Tabor's fortune and his far-flung holdings were sold off. Still a respected public figure, he was made postmaster of Denver from January 4, 1898 until his death the following year.

When he became terminally ill with appendicitis in 1899, Tabor's final request of Baby Doe was that she maintain the Matchless claim. Legend reports that she did but later lost control of the mine. She lived in the tool shed of the Matchless mine for thirty years and died in that shed.

Augusta Tabor, however, prospered in her later years; on her death in 1895, she was among the wealthiest citizens of Denver.

When Horace Tabor died in 1899, flags were flown at half staff and ten thousand people were reported to have attended his funeral. His body was interred at Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Denver and later reinterred at Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Jefferson County, Colorado, where it now rests beside that of Baby Doe.

In his remembrance, there is a Tabor Lake at the base of Tabor Peak approximately 12 miles (19Â km) southwest of Leadville, just south of Independence Pass.

The actor Don Haggerty played Tabor in the 1967 episode "Chicken Bill" of the syndicated television series Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor. Dub Taylor played the title role of the silver miner Chicken Bill Lovell, who in the story line salts his mine to get Tabor to pay off Lovell's lingering debt and to fund his continued operation.
