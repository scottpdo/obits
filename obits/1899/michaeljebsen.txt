Michael Jebsen



During the late summer of 1899, while visiting a spa resort, Michael Jebsen was taken ill.   He was transferred to Berlin where he underwent an operation and, on 30 September, died.   Two months later, in a ceremony that was very much quieter than must have been envisaged on 28 May 1899 when he couple announced their engagement, his daughter Joanne married her cousin, Heinrich Jessen, consolidating family connections that underpinned the Hong Kong-based Jebsen Group.
