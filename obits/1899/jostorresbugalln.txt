José Torres Bugallón



On February 4, 1899, the Philippine–American War erupted. Bugallon rejoined Luna in the field immediately.

The next day, February 5, saw them in La Loma hill, the present day site of La Loma Cemetery, between Manila and Caloocan City. While holding the line, American troops under General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. charged and outflanked them. As a result, Bugallon and his men were exposed to enemy fire, and he sustained a bullet in his thighs.

Upon learning from that Bugallón was wounded, Luna ordered: 





“

Bugallón wounded. Order forward. He must be saved at all costs. Bugallón is worth 500 Filipino soldiers. He is one of my hopes for future victory.

”





Luna found Bugallón severely wounded and prostrate in a ditch along the road. "Don't expose yourself so much. Don't advance any farther," Bugallón said.

For his bravery, Luna immediately promoted Bugallón to lieutenant colonel. The wounded hero was rushed by train to the medical station in Caloocan, hoping that he could be kept alive until he can be brought to the hospital in Malolos. However, it was too late; after inquiring if the Filipino reinforcements have arrived, and expired in Luna's arms. Allegedly, Luna unashamedly wept for Bugallón.
