Isabel Larrañaga Ramírez



In 1894 Mother Isabel sent a religious expedition to Cuba in spite of the delicate political situation during that time. During her second trip to Cuba, she suffered from heart problems which were aggravated with sufferings from the war, which eventually led to her death on January 17, 1899. She left a flourishing institute that, after her death, has extended on the following nations: Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Peru, and Chile.
