Florence Marryat



Marryat became active in the Society of Authors, founded in 1884, and also began to breed bulldogs and terriers. Over the last 14 years of her life, she had a relationship with a younger actor, Herbert McPherson, who inherited half of her estate. During the 1890s, she ran a school of Journalism and Literary Art. She continued writing for the rest of her life, and some of her best known books were her late-career writings on spiritualism, and included There Is No Death (1891), The Spirit World (1894) and A Soul on Fire. She influenced wiccan Gerald Gardner in his youth.

Marryat died in 1899 from diabetes and pneumonia and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.
