Leopold Ullstein



Leopold Ullstein died 4 December 1899. He was 73 years old at the time of his death.

Ullstein's publishing empire was carried on after his death by his five children, one of whom, Hermann Ullstein, emigrated from Nazi Germany in December 1938 and published a history of the Ullstein firm.

Following the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in 1933, the Ullstein publishing empire was forcibly "Aryanized." In 1934 the firm, valued at 60 million marks, was sold under duress for 6 million marks.
