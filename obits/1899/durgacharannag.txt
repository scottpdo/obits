Durga Charan Nag



Nag Mahasaya died in 1899 in a condition of abject poverty and indebtedness. Sarat Chandra Chakravarty who witnessed his death mentions that even in his death bed it was his prime concern to serve his guests who came to see him and to talk about Sri Ramakrishna. Swami Saradananda, a leading monk of Ramakrishna Order and a brother disciple who at this time was in Dacca also came to see him. Apparently Nag Mahasaya also selected the precise date and time of his departure.

The last moments of his life are documented in the book "Life of Nag Mahasaya" by Sarat Chandra Chakravarty and can be read in detail in the following website - Life of Nag Mahasaya - link is spam

His last words were, "Grace, grace, grace out of Thine own boundless mercy."

After his death a photograph was taken of his body which is now reproduced in all writings related to him.
