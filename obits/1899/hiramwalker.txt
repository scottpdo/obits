Hiram Walker



  Hiram Walker's Grave, Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan


Walker had fallen ill many times since 1883.  Due to his illness, he spent a lot of time at home, and on the water in Lake Erie.  A popular spot in which he journeyed to often was an island he owned known as the Ile Aux Peche, which he sold to his daughter.  He lost feeling in his right leg around 1890 due to his rheumatism and walked with a cane.  In 1895, he suffered a severe paralytic stroke and lost the feeling in his legs two years later.  From April 1898 until his death, he suffered two cases of Congestive Apoplexy.  His second attack was on January 10, 1899.  Walker died two days later in Detroit, Michigan, January 12, 1899. He is buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.
His direct descendants are of the Julia Elizabeth (Walker) Buhl, Franklin MacFie Walker and Elizabeth Talman (Walker) Paterson families.

The news of the death of Walker took a large toll on the town.  Flags were lowered, and mayor Robert Kerr made a public statement.  Walkerâ€™s casket remained in his residence in Detroit until the funeral took place. The Detroit News reported that family, friends and fellow co-workers visited for hours prior to the funeral service on January 14, 1899.  The casket made entirely of metal, but covered with black and massive floral decorations, which was incredibly rare for the time.  The flowers were donated by Hiram Walker & Sons, along with the Children's Free Hospital.
