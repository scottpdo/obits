Marvin Stone



Stone used the newfound wealth from his straw business for a variety of philanthropic causes. He furnished lodging for his female employees, including a large library, music room, meeting room, and dancing floor. In addition, he and several others built two blocks of tenement houses for African American residents of Washington, D.C.

Stone died in his home in Columbia Road, Washington, D.C., on May 17, 1899 after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, Jane "Jennie" Platt. Stone is buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.
