Christian Friele



  Friele's tomb at Vår Frelsers gravlund


Friele was twice in his life offered a knighthood of the Order of St. Olav; he rejected both offers. The first time he turned down the offer with the words: "Editor of the Royal Norwegian Morgenbladet, what? No safer way to compromise the position of the paper and its editor!"; the second with the words: "Would your Majesty force me to leave the country?".

He died on 24 January 1899 in Kristiania and was buried in Vår Frelsers gravlund together with his wife. Friele occurs rather frequently in the contemporary literature: Ibsen's character Daniel Heire has acquired some properties from Friele; Knut Hamsun describes him briefly in Hunger; in Alexander Kielland's Arbeidsfolk he receives contemptuous treatment; and Bjørnson wrote a play titled Redaktøren ("the Editor") in which Friele is the protagonist. The conservative politician C. J. Hambro described him thus:



Men with greater names and with higher status in history are forgotten and will remain so. Christian Friele will be remembered; the memory and the myth have glossed his name and mitigated the sharp echo it once had. He is the first man in Norwegian history who will be remembered for being a journalist.
