H. L. Mackenzie



Mackenzie died while in Swatow on December 26, 1899. He was survived by his four children, though his wife had died several years earlier. Mackenzie was admired for his willingness to venture away from the center of the mission and out into surrounding areas, where he would provide medical assistance and spread the gospel to previously overlooked communities. Mackenzie persevered in his missionary work in spite of the absence of three of his children, who remained in Scotland, and the death of his wife, who passed away while accompanying Mackenzie at the Swatow mission. Mackenzie laid the groundwork for the continued development of the Swatow mission after his death, with an Anglo-Chinese college being constructed in 1905â€“06. His founding of the Taiwan Mission and translation of the scriptures into Swatow dialect were also accomplishments that would have a meaningful impact on future generations of Chinese.
