During his illness he was served by Kalyanananda, a direct disciple of Vivekananda. Sister Nivedita was one of the witnesses to his death and she had described the moments of his passing away in one of her letters to Josephine MacLeod. During his last days he was nursed by Yogin Ma and his death affected Sarada Devi.
