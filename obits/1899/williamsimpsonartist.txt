William Simpson (artist)



Simpson married late in life and had one daughter, Penelope, who eventually emigrated to Australia. 
He died at home in Willesden, North London, on 17 August 1899, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.

Besides his war pictures, he covered state events, coronations, funerals, and other ceremonies. 
He was particularly interested in India and sketched scenes of the Kashmir Maharajas. 
He was a noted ethnographer and antiquarian, and wrote extensively on ancient religions, customs, and ancient artifacts.  
It is said that the Queen intervened to prevent him from going out to Italy in 1859, to cover the Austro-Sardinian War, for fear that he would get killed.
