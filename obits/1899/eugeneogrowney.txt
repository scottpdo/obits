Eugene O'Growney



In 1894, failing health caused him to go to Arizona and California, where he died. Some years after, with the aid of Irish sympathisers in the United States, his body was brought back to Ireland

His funeral, held on 26 September 1903 at the Catholic Pro-Cathedral, Dublin, was attended by 6,000 people, including members of the trade guilds, clerics, politicians, members of the nationalist Gaelic Athletic Association and students. 

He is buried in the cemetery attached to St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.
