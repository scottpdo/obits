John Joyce (New Zealand politician)



Joyce died suddenly on 1 December 1899. He was in the midst of the 1899 general election campaign when he started to have heart problems. He saw a doctor in the morning, was prescribed rest, and died in the early evening during his sleep.

His funeral was described as one of the largest ever in the colony, and was attended by several thousand people. Due to his previous involvement with the Canterbury volunteer forces, he was given a full military funeral. The railways estimated that they transported 400 soldiers and about 2500 others to Lyttelton to the funeral.

Joyce was married in 1864 to a daughter of Mr. G. Coates (a jeweller from Christchurch), and he was survived by his wife, four sons and six daughters. Joyce Street in Lyttelton is named after him.
