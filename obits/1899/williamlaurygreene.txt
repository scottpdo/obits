William Laury Greene



After Congress adjourned in March 1899, Greene traveled to Lincoln, Nebraska to observe the legislative election for U.S. Senator.  On March 10, he traveled from Lincoln to Omaha on business.  On March 11, Greene and several friends traveled from his Omaha hotel to the train station by carriage, and upon arrival at the station, his friends observed that he was laying down on the back seat.  They were unable to revive him, so they carried him into the train station and summoned medical aid.  A doctor soon arrived, who determined that Greene had died, and the cause of death was heart failure.

Greene's funeral took place at First Baptist Church in Kearney.  He was interred in Kearney Cemetery.
