  Furman Hall on the campus of Vanderbilt University


Furman Hall on the campus of Vanderbilt University in Nashville is named in his honor. It was the result of a US$100,000 donation by his widow after his death, even though he never attended the university. Inside the building, there is a sculpture of Francis Furman. From 1907 to 1967, it housed the Chemistry and Physics Department. Since 1967, it has been home to the Humanities Department.
