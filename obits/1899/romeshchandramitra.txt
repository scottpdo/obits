Romesh Chandra Mitra



Mitter offered his resignation in 1889 and he formally retired from the court on 1 January 1890. He had been late to an appointment at court, having forgotten about it, and believed that his mistake was unfitting for his position. He was knighted in June 1890 and died on 13 July 1899.[citation needed]
