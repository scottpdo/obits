Manuel Carrillo Tablas



On New Year's Eve 1899 Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas died. His son Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga (born in 1868 and who would served as Political Chief of the Canton of Orizaba during the early 1900s), would take up the helm as the head of the family. Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga married Doña María Limón (from San Luis Potosí) and both lived in Orizaba, Veracruz.
Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga would also serve in the Mexican Congress as a Diputado during the rewriting of the Mexican Constitution in 1917.

Because Don Manuel died without a will, the government of Mexico seized much of his possessions, leaving his children to battle the courts to retain what they could of their father's vast wealth. At the time of Don Manuel Carrillo Tablas' death, families of status and wealth were buried in private lots on their ranch. Looters disturbed the remains of Don Manuel searching for jewels and left Don Manuel's remains unearthed. His son, Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga, brought the remains to his family's Hacienda known as "El Molino de la Alianza." Upon the death of Don Manuel Carrillo Iturriaga, his daughter Doña Guadalupe Carrillo viuda de Ortega buried both her father and grandfather in the city's cemetery, in the family plot.  The renowned musician and Maestro Armando Ortega is also buried in the same family plot.
