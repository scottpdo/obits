William Burgess Pryer



Pryer completely retired from working in 1892 after an agreement with the supervisory board of the North Borneo Chartered Company to acquired his estate about 20 kilometres north of Sandakan along with a further property at Kabeli, an inflow of Sandakan Bay where Pryer used to cultivate sugar cane, nutmeg, cocoa, cotton, gambier plant and rubber. At the same time, his health have been getting worsened; as he was increasingly suffering from severe and unexplained painful conditions. Following this, Pryer decided to return to England in 1898. Pryer died on the way to England between 7â€“8 January 1899 at Suez and was buried there on 11 January. He left his wife without any children.
