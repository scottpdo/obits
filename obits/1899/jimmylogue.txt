Jimmy Logue



Jimmy died penniless of oedema of the lungs on October 4, 1899 in the Philadelphia County almshouse, and was buried in the cemetery of Church of St. James the Less along with his beloved wife Joanna. He'd given up robbery and repented his sins, though he never forgave his stepson and nephew for Joanna's murder.
