Daniel Montgomery Boyd



Boyd married twice during his lifetime. His first wife was Caroline A. Bockius, daughter of Samuel Blockius of Germantown; they married in 1869. After her death in 1878, Boyd married Ida Cottrell, daughter of Joseph W. Cottrell of Columbia. This union produced two children: Daniel Montgomery and Elsie M.

Boyd and his family were all members of the Presbyterian Church, and Boyd was a trustee of the church. He was a Republican throughout his entire life. Boyd built a house in Queen Anne style at 5 Bloom Street in Danville in the 1880s. He was living in this house as late as 1899, the year of his death.

Boyd suffered from a serious attack of influenza in the winter of 1897/1898 and his health never fully recovered. He died on July 4, 1899 at the age of 73.

According to J.H. Beers' Historical and Biographical Annals of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania, Boyd was "one of the men to whom Montour County owes a debt of gratitude for his share in its development and prosperity". He provided aid in getting many of Danville's industries to a financially stable state and contributed to the social and business development of Danville. An 1899 book described him as a "liberal supporter financially of all worthy enterprises".
