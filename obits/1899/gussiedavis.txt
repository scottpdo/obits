Gussie Davis



An April 1899 article in The Freeman reported that Davis had purchased a home in Whitestone, New York and that he was recovering from a serious illness.  In August of that year, press releases indicated he would appear in A Hot Old Time in Dixie, going on the road in the coming season; this musical farce was Davis's property with Tom McIntosh.  On October 18, 1899, Davis died at home in Whitestone.

At the time of his death, Gussie Davis had published more than three hundred songs and certainly left more in manuscript.
