Arthur Stayner



Stayner became a prominent citizen of Salt Lake City.  He died on 4 September 1899, from sepsis stemming from a lead pellet which became embedded in his heel.  Although amputation of his limb was considered by a physician, the infection had permeated his body and it was too late to save him.

Although Stayner was not interested in financial gain from sugar manufacture, because of his energetic work he is regarded as the "father and founder of the movement that made the manufacture of sugar in Utah a success."
