Thomas Henry Ismay



Shortly after the launching of the Oceanic on 14 January 1899, Thomas Henry Ismay began to complain of pains in his chest. Throughout his life he had been very active and was seldom sick, so his doctor took his pains very seriously. His condition slowly deteriorated and construction on Oceanic's sister ships was delayed. In March of that year, Thomas's health began to improve, and he and Margaret went to Windermere where he became sick again. Mrs Margaret summoned a doctor and a dose of morphine was given to Ismay. After 6 days he was feeling better and he returned to Dawpool in Thurstaston, Wirral. Within 6 weeks he had more violent pain. The doctor diagnosed it as a gallstone. By 26 April Ismay felt good enough to work, but in August he collapsed and was confined to bed. On 31 August an operation was performed on Ismay to try to alleviate his condition. The operation was unsuccessful and a second one became necessary on 4 September. The next morning he insisted that his daughters go on a voyage on the Oceanic whilst he talked to his wife. He asked his wife to arrange for the local church to pray for him. On 14 September Thomas suffered a heart attack. His condition continued to worsen and on 23 November Thomas Henry Ismay died at the age of 62. His wife never fully recovered and she died 7 years later.

He and his wife are commemorated with a large grave at St Bartholomew's Church, Thurstaston, Wirral, inscribed: "Great thoughts, great feelings came to him like instincts unawares" and "Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God."
