Fredrik Glad Balchen



In 1873, Balchen was rewarded the Order of St. Olav for his efforts for the deaf. He was also appointed member of a committee that should prepare a law granting the deaf, blind and mentally handicapped the right to compulsory education. A such law came into force for the deaf on 1 July 1883, for the blind in 1885 and for the mentally handicapped in 1891. After having stepped down from his positions at the deaf school, Balchen died, at age 84.
