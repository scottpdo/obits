# Robert Knight, 1st Earl of Catherlough

The Earl died on 30 March 1772, aged 69, and was buried at Ullenhall. His will dated 11 February 1772 was proved on 10 April 1772. All his peerages became extinct on his death on 30 March 1772, his son Hon. Henry Knight (1728–62), having predeceased him.

# Ahmad Shah Durrani

Durrani died on 16 October 1772 in Kandahar Province. He was buried in the city of Kandahar adjacent to the Shrine of the Cloak, where a large tomb was built. It has been described in the following way:

In his tomb his epitaph is written:

Durrani's victory over the Marathas influenced the history of the subcontinent and, in particular, British policy in the region. His refusal to continue his campaigns deeper into India prevented a clash with the East India Company and allowed them to continue to acquire power and influence after they took complete control of the former Mughal province of Bengal in 1793. However, fear of another Afghan invasion was to haunt British policy for almost half a century after the battle of Panipat. The acknowledgment of Abdali's military accomplishments is reflected in a British intelligence report on the Battle of Panipat, which referred to Ahmad Shah as the 'King of Kings'. This fear led in 1798 to a British envoy being sent to the Persian court in part to instigate the Persians in their claims on Herat to forestall an Afghan invasion of India that might have halted British East India company's expansion. Mountstuart Elphinstone wrote of Ahmad Shah:

His successors, beginning with his son Timur and ending with Shuja Shah Durrani, proved largely incapable of governing the last Afghan empire and faced with advancing enemies on all sides. Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others by the end of the 19th century. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated some Pashtun tribes and those of other Durrani lineages. Until Dost Mohammad Khan's ascendancy in 1826, chaos reigned in Afghanistan, which effectively ceased to exist as a single entity, disintegrating into a fragmented collection of small countries or units. This policy ensured that he did not continue on the path of other conquerors like Babur or Muhammad of Ghor and make India the base for his empire.

In Pakistan, a short-range ballistic missile Abdali-I, is named in the honour of Ahmed Shah Abdali.

# Samuel Fothergill

In 1760 he was appointed one of a committee to visit all the quarterly and other meetings in the kingdom, and in 1762 he visited most of the Quaker meetings in Ireland. A similar service in Scotland two years later led largely to the revival of Quakerism in that country. From this time till his death he was unable to take any active part in the affairs of the Society of Friends, and his later years were passed in great suffering. He died at Warrington in June 1772, and was buried in the Friends' burial-ground at Penketh, Lancashire.

Fothergill was well read in books, and a keen student of men and manners. He is described as having been dignified, courteous, grave, and yet affable. His writings were chiefly tracts or brief addresses, but the number of times they have been reprinted proves them to have been highly valued by the Quakers.

# Robert Gillow

He died in 1772.

# David Hall (publisher)

Hall died on December 24, 1772, and is buried at Christ Church cemetery in Philadelphia.

# Sir Justinian Isham, 5th Baronet

Isham died without issue, suddenly, on 5 March 1737, probably from a stroke or heart attack, and was succeeded as baronet by his younger brother Edmund Isham, who also followed him as the 
Northamptonshire representative to Parliament. There is a painting of Sir Justinian by Hugh Howard that hangs at Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire.

# Jean-Louis Le Loutre

Aware of his risk, Le Loutre escaped to Quebec through the woods. In the late summer, he returned to Louisbourg and sailed to France. His ship was seized by the British in September 1755, and Le Loutre was taken prisoner. After three months in Plymouth, he was held in Elizabeth Castle, Jersey, for eight years, until after the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1763) that ended the Seven Years' War.

After that, he tried to help Acadians deported to France to settle in areas such as Morlaix, Saint-Malo, and Poitou. Le Loutre died at Nantes on 30 September 1772 on a trip to Poitou to show Acadians the land. He was buried the following day at the Church of St. Leonard. Le Loutre willed his worldly possessions to the displaced Acadians.

Historian Micheline Johnson has described him as "the soul of the Acadian resistance," and he enjoyed wide support amongst French-Canadian priest-historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.  A street of Gatineau, Quebec is named in his memory.

# Norman MacLeod (The Wicked Man)

Norman MacLeod died on 21 July 1772, and was buried in the kirkyard of St Andrew's Cathedral, in St Andrews. The grave lies against the north boundary wall.

He was succeeded by his grandson, Norman MacLeod.

# Madhavrao I

In June 1770, Peshwas set out to conquer Hyder Ali for the third time. However, Madhavrao was infected with tuberculosis which started deteriorating his health. Tuberculosis was also termed as “Raj-Yakshma” or the prince of diseases. Madhavrao had to return from Miraj as the effects of the disease had started becoming prominent. He was even recommended an English doctor for treatment of the terrible disease and he would follow the advice given by the doctor. However, there were no signs of improvement and slowly it started developing further. The disease had affected his intestine. There was no cure for tuberculosis in those times. Madhavrao decided to spend his last days in his favourite Ganesha Chintamani Temple, Theur.

On 6 October 1772, Raghunathrao tried to escape from the house arrest at Shaniwar Wada, but he was caught again. Madhavrao had become excessively weak, and he could no longer bear such incidents. He had constructed a garden, a wooden hall and a fountain outside this favourite temple.

18 November 1772, early morning approximately at eight: Madhavrao died at the temple premises of Chintamani, Theur. Thousands of citizens visited the site and paid their last respects. Madhavrao was cremated on the banks of the river which was about half a mile from the temple. A small memorial carved out of stone rests today at that place as a memorial.

His wife Ramabai chose to commit sati with his body at the time of cremation, even though Brahmin widows were not required to follow the ritual.

# Andrew Montour

Montour died on January 20, 1772. Major Isaac Hamilton wrote from Fort Pitt on January 22, 1772, reporting that Montour: "...was killed at his own house the day before yesterday by a Seneca Indian, who had been entertained by him at his house for some days. He was buried this day near the Fort."

For their tribute, "the Indians who came to the funeral beg'd a few gallons of Rum to drown their sorrows for the life of their friend." The cost of the spirits for the Indian's lamentations was pegged at a little better than £7.

# Charles Ridgely II

At the time of his death in 1772, Ridgely's estate was valued at £6,285.16.9 British  pounds sterling, then current money, including 36 slaves, 6 servants, 121 oz. plate, his one-third interest in the Northampton Ironworks valued at £322.9.3 pounds sterling, and 603 pounds worth of goods shipped by London merchants.  He died at "Northampton", (at future Hampton Mansion and near Towsontown/Towson),  Baltimore County, Maryland, and his will was probated on June 8, 1772.

# William Stanhope (1702–1772)

In the last years of his life Stanhope spent much time in the south of France, and he died at Dijon on 7 May 1772. His only child, Elizabeth, a daughter by his first marriage, married Welbore Ellis. The house at Eythrope was demolished in 1810 to 1811 by Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield.Two of Stanhope’s buildings survive: the grotto by the lake and the bridge over the River Thame.

# Nathan Webb

Webb served in Uxbridge until his death there at the age of 66. The Worcester County history text reports that he "continued in the faithful service of the Master" until his death.

He bequeathed "16 British Sterling Pounds to the church for the purposes of purchasing 3 silver cups to be engraved with the names of Nathan Webb, Ruth Webb, and Elizabeth Webb." He then bequeathed 26 Pounds, 13 Shillings, and 4 cents (N. B. Webb's estate was in total much more than the 24 pounds Sterling paid to the Nipmuc for the original land deed to the entire 8 Mile by 8 mile square plantation granted to settlers in 1662 for what became Mendon and other towns) to be invested and improved forever toward the work of the learned, pious and orthodox Congregational ministry of said church forever". The title of the sermon given on his death was, "The godly fathers and a defence to their people [electronic resource"] : A sermon delivered at Uxbridge, April 19, 1772, occasioned by the death of the late Reverend Nathan Webb, Pastor of said church and people: containing a summary of his character. : And now published, at the desire of many of the hearers, to revive and perpetuate the memory of their said pastor. / By Ebenezer Chaplin, A.M. Pastor of a church in Sutton."

Webb's funeral was held on April 19, 1772, exactly three years before the Battles of Lexington and Concord.

The present location of the Congregational Church, in the Uxbridge Common District, changed from the 1830s due to a split with the more liberal Unitarian Church tradition.
