# Agaja

Agaja died in Allada a few months after returning following the war with Oyo in 1740. Oral traditions say that Tegbessou, who was the fifth oldest son of Agaja, was told by Agaja earlier that because he had saved Dahomey from the Oyo Empire he was going to be the king rather than any of his older brothers, although that tradition may have been created by Tegbessou to legitimize his rule.  Regardless, the result was a contest between him and his brothers upon Agaja's death. In the end, Tegbessou was victorious and became the new king of Dahomey.

# Anna of Russia

As her health declined Anna declared her grandnephew, Ivan VI, as her successor and appointed Biron as regent. This was an attempt to secure the line of her father, Ivan V, and exclude the descendants of Peter the Great from inheriting the throne. It was recorded that she had an ulcer on her kidneys, and she continued having attacks of gout; as her condition worsened, her health began to fail.

Anna died on October 17, 1740 at the age of 47 from a terrible kidney stone that made for a slow and painful death. The tsaritsa's final words focused on Biron. Ivan VI was only a two-month-old baby at the time, and his mother, Anna Leopoldovna, was detested for her German counsellors and relations. As a consequence, shortly after Anna's death, Elizabeth Petrovna, legitimized daughter of Peter the Great, managed to gain the favor of the populace, locked Ivan VI in a dungeon, and exiled his mother. Anna was buried three months later on January 15, 1741, leaving behind uncertainty for the future of Russia.

# Baji Rao I

Baji Rao died on 28 April 1740, at the age of 39 of a sudden fever, possibly heat stroke, while inspecting his occupied parts of territory that were also called jagirs at that time[citation needed] At that time, he was en route Delhi with nearly 100,000 troops under his command at his camp in the Khargone district, near the city of Indore.[citation needed] He was cremated on the same day at Raverkhedi on Narmada River.

The Scindias built a chhatri as a memorial at this place.[citation needed] The memorial is enclosed by a dharmashala. The compound has two temples, dedicated to Nilkantheshwara Mahadeva(Shiva) and Rameshvara(Rama).

# Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor

At the time of Charles' death, the Habsburg lands were saturated in debt; the exchequer contained a mere 100,000 florins; and desertion was rife in Austria's sporadic army, spread across the Empire in small, ineffective barracks. Contemporaries expected that Austria-Hungary would wrench itself from the Habsburg yoke upon his death.

The Emperor, after a hunting trip across the Hungarian border in "a typical day in the wettest and coldest October in memory", fell seriously ill at the Favorita Palace, Vienna, and he died on 20 October 1740 in the Hofburg. In his Memoirs Voltaire wrote that Charles' death was caused by consuming a meal of death cap mushrooms. Charles' life opus, the Pragmatic Sanction, was ultimately in vain. Maria Theresa was forced to resort to arms to defend her inheritance from the coalition of Prussia, Bavaria, France, Spain, Saxony and Poland—all party to the sanction—who assaulted the Austrian frontier weeks after her father's death. During the ensuing War of the Austrian Succession, Maria Theresa saved her crown and most of her territory but lost the mineral-rich Duchy of Silesia to Prussia and the Duchy of Parma to Spain.

Emperor Charles VI has been the main motif of many collectors' coins and medals.  One of the most recent samples is high value collectors' coin the Austrian Göttweig Abbey commemorative coin, minted on 11 October 2006. His portrait can be seen in the foreground of the reverse of the coin.

# Sir Charles Crisp, 5th Baronet

Crisp died without issue on 9 July 1740 and the baronetcy became extinct. His estate, including Dornford, passed to female relations, among them Mary Crispe, daughter of Sir John Crispe, 3rd Baronet. She had married George Stonehouse, in 1739.

# John Gagnier

# Sarfaraz Khan

Sarfaraz was stark unlucky to have an opponent like Alivardi who besides being an excellent leader even at the age of 70, knew Sarfaraz's weaknesses. Sarfaraz Khan was defeated and killed in the Battle of Giria on the banks of the river Bhagirathi. The incumbent Alivardi Khan, the Nazim of Azimabad (Patna) defeated him in a direct conflict. The battle was short but bloody and intense given the "loyalty standards" of the time. The outcome was decided early by Sarfaraz Khan falling to a bullet. The remnants of his army continued to put up a brave resistance but Alivardi Khan was too good a general for them.

The primary cause for this debacle was that Sarfaraz never saw what was coming in the form of Alivardi Khan and did not take precautionary measures in time. Besides, Alivardi did not give him much time to settle down. Sarfaraz was more concerned of the "bigger threat" Nadir Shah who was vandalising Delhi and Punjab. Nadir had in fact written to Sarfaraz which aggravated matters further. He can be best described as mild mannered person who neither had the opportunity nor the exceptional merit required to leave a "mark" on history on such troubled times and was consigned to the footnotes of history.

Sarfaraz Khan's reign was for a little over 13 months. The Nasiri Dynasty of Murshid Quli Khan ended with the death of Sarfaraz Khan. Sarfaraz Khan had five sons and five daughters who never made it to the doors of power thus Alivardi Khan toppled the Nasiri Nawabs and became the new Nawab of Bengal. Alivardi Khan also founded the Afshar Dynasty. He lies buried at Naginabag in Murshidabad.

# Maria Anna of Neuburg

Maria Anna lived quietly in Toledo until 1706, when the forces of her nephew Archduke Charles briefly occupied the city. Her enthusiastic reception resulted in her expulsion from Spain a few years later and she settled in Bayonne, France, where she lived for the next few decades, largely forgotten, allegedly marrying a local barrel-maker.

In 1739, being old and sick, she was allowed to return to Spain and given lodging in the Infantado Palace in Guadalajara, where she died on 16 July 1740. She was buried in El Escorial Monastery.

# Mastani

Mastani died in 1740, shortly after Bajirao's death. Her cause of death is still unknown. It is said that Mastani committed suicide by consuming poison after Bajirao's death while some says that she died from shock after she came to know that Bajirao's had died or was assassinated by Bajirao's family. A tale suggests that Mastani committed sati on Bajirao's funeral pyre. Mastani was buried in the village of Pabal. Given her association with both Hinduism and Islam, her grave is called both Mastani's samadhi and Mastani's mazar.

# John Monro (surgeon)

John Monro married twice. In 1694 he  married his first cousin Jean Forbes, granddaughter of the first Duncan Forbes of Culloden. They had one son Alexander Monro primus (1697–1767). In turn his son, who would become Prof Alexander Monro secundus (1733–1817) also held the chair of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh as did his son who would become Prof Alexander Monro tertius (1773–1859) Between them these 3 men occupied the chair of Anatomy for a total of 126 years, from 1720-1846. They were distant relatives of the 'Bedlam Monros' another dynasty, known for their treatment of insanity in London. 
Jean Monro died c 1710. In August 1721 John Monro married Margaret Main (née Crichton) and she outlived him. In later years he lived at Carolside near Earlston in Berwickshire, where he died in 1740.

# Richard Lumley, 2nd Earl of Scarbrough

Lord Scarbrough committed suicide by shooting himself through the roof of the mouth on 29 January 1740, aged 53. At the time of his death it was rumoured to have been brought on by a mental disorder he developed from a knock on the head when he had an accident in his carriage a few days before. This, however, seems to have been a story circulated by his friends to disguise the truth of the matter. He had been due to marry the dowager Duchess of Manchester, but she had betrayed a secret sensitive to the King, told to her by the Earl. The King, on discovering the error in judgement by his minister, proclaimed, "Lumley, you have lost a friend and I a good servant." It is thought that the honourable Earl could not bear this dishonour and took his own life as a direct result of the Duchess disclosing what he had told her in confidence.

Far from being an act resulting from mental disorder, there is contemporary evidence that he knew full well what he was doing. Books were discovered at the scene of his death laid open at specific places for the benefit of close friends.

Lord Scarborough was buried on 4 February 1740 in Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street, Mayfair. The chapel stands today much as it did in 1740, despite there being no marker for the Earl.

Dying unmarried and without male issue, Scarborough's titles passed to his brother, Thomas.

# Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan

A great perturbation was caused in 1739 by the approach of Nader Shah. Shuja ud-Din fell ill and fearing his death he sent Durdan Begum and his son to Odisha. He also appointed Sarfaraz Khan as his heir and successor. He also enjoined Sarfaraz Khan to regard Haji Ahmed, Alam Chand (Roy Royan Alam Chand) and Jagat Seth as his steadfast counsellor and was to follow their advice in all affairs of moment. But, Sarfaraz Khan had no cordiality towards them and promised to obey Shuja ud-Din's commands, fearing to offend his dying father. Shuja ud-Din died on 26 August 1739 leaving behind two sons and two daughters. He lies buried in Roshnibag in Murshidabad. Shuja ud-Din Muhammad Khan was succeeded by his son, Sarfaraz Khan. His death coincided with the invasion of Delhi by Nader Shah.

In that year, Alivardi Khan (army commander of Sarfaraz Khan) with the help of Jagat Seths and few powerful land magnets deposed and killed Sarfaraz Khan. Alivardi Khan then proclaimed himself as next Nawab of Bengal.

Shuja-ud-Din left behind a very rich and prosperous Bengal to a very average successor, Sarfaraz Khan who had contenders (certainly) better than him. The Nasiri Dynasty lasted for another thirteen months and ended with Sarfaraz Khan.

# Sir William Stapleton, 4th Baronet
