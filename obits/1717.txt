# Fernando de Alencastre, 1st Duke of Linares

In 1716 he turned over the office to his successor, Baltasar de Zúñiga, 1st Duke of Arión. He left for Zúñiga a written Instrucción, in which he detailed the sad social and economic conditions of the colony.

He died the following year in Mexico City, and was interred in the church of the Discalced Carmelites.  He left many charitable donations in his will, including an addition 5,000 for the Jesuit missions of Baja California.

# Samuel Bellamy

Just two months after acquiring the Whydah, as she and the Marianne approached Cape Cod, Williams told Bellamy that he wished to visit his family in Rhode Island, and the two agreed to meet up again near Maine. Bellamy and the Whydah captured several other small vessels in the area, including the Anne Galley, to which he appointed his quartermaster Richard Noland as Captain.

If Bellamy intended to revisit his lover Maria Hallett, he failed.  The Whydah was swept up in a violent nor'easter storm off Cape Cod at midnight, on April 26, 1717 and was driven onto the sand bar shoals in 16 feet of water some 500 feet from the coast of what is now Wellfleet, Massachusetts. At 15 minutes past midnight, the masts snapped and drew the heavily loaded ship into 30 feet of water where she capsized and quickly sank, taking Bellamy and all but two of the Whydah's 145-man crew with her.

One hundred and three bodies were known to have washed ashore and were buried by the town coroner, leaving 41 bodies unaccounted for. The Mary Anne was also wrecked that night several miles south of the Whydah, leaving seven more survivors.  All nine survivors from the two ships were captured and prosecuted for piracy in Boston, and six were hanged in October 1717 (King George's pardon of all pirates, issued the previous month in September, arrived in Boston three weeks too late).  Two were set free, the court believing their testimony that they had been forced into piracy.  The last, a Miskito Indian from Central America, John Julian, is believed to have been sold into slavery to John Quincy, the great-grandfather of U.S. President John Quincy Adams.

Williams waited for Bellamy to rendezvous; when Bellamy never appeared, Williams realized what had happened, and sailed south to Nassau in the Marianne. Noland also searched for Bellamy off Maine; failing to find him, he took the Anne Galley south, raiding ships along the way before accepting a pardon in the Bahamas.

# John Gray (Episcopalian minister)

John died in 1717 and is buried in St Mary Haddington where his grave is marked by a 'flat ornamental stone'.

John's testament gifted his library, of at that point 900 volumes, 'for the use and behoofe of the poor of the Toun' and by so doing he founded the town library.

In addition to the library, John left a grant of 3,000 merks which was to be used in the following ways:

This gift of his library has led some to refer to him as the 'father of public libraries in East Lothian'.

His library was transferred to the National Library of Scotland, where it is now accessible to the public. His Library now comprises over 1,500 volumes, as more were acquired in line with his wishes, and is 'perhaps the finest collection of early printed books in Scotland.' with a 'varied assortment of specimens of early printing and binding'. Within this collection is a book previously owned by John Donne and the collection itself has already been the subject of scholarly research.

Within Haddington, a new Heritage Centre and library were named after him which opened in 2012.  As part of the development of the project a school-based animation project was run in the county with 180 pupils participating the a summary of this output has been shared here on YouTube. The individual films are also available on the same channel and were discussed at the time on some of the School blogs.

# Nicola Grimaldi I

# Jeanne Guyon

In 1704, her works were published in the Netherlands, becoming very popular. Many English and Germans visited her at Blois, among them Johann Wettstein and Lord Forbes. She spent the remainder of her life in retirement with her daughter, the Marquise de Bois, at Blois, where she died at the age of 69, believing that she had died submissive to the Catholic Church, from which she had never had any intention of separating herself.

Her published works, the Moyen Court and the Règles des associées à l'Enfance de Jésus, were both placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1688. Fénelon's Maximes des saints was also condemned by both the Pope and the bishops of France.

An anonymous 18th-century manuscript, hand-written in French, entitled "Supplement to the life of Madame Guyon" exists in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, which sets forth many fresh details about the Great Conflict which surrounded Madame Guyon.

# Joseph Jenckes Jr.

Joseph Jenckes Jr. died January 4, 1717, in northern Providence, now Pawtucket.

Two Pawtucket schools were named in his honor. Joseph Jenks Jr. High School—a high school no longer operating—was built in 1896 at 300 Broadway. Joseph Jenks Junior High School was opened in downtown Pawtucket in the 1920s and moved in the 1980s to 350 Division Street where it was renamed Joseph Jenks Middle School.

The street called Jenks Way in Pawtucket is near Pawtucket Falls.

# Lha-bzang Khan

Lha-bzang Khan was staying in the Dam region when he heard about the unexpected invasion. At this time he was an old man, overweight and a heavy drinker. His able officer Pholhane suggested the king guard the pass between Dam and Lhasa with musketeers, but Lha-bzang preferred to meet the enemy on the open plain. Meanwhile, Dzungar spies spread the word that they had come to avenge the death of Sangye Gyatso, return power over the country to the Tibetans themselves, and expel the "false" Dalai Lama Ngawang Yeshe Gyatso. This had effect. The troops of Lha-bzang were defeated and withdrew to Lhasa which was hastily put in a state of defence. The city was besieged by the Dzungars and eventually stormed on a dark night at the end of November. Treason helped the enterprise since ladders were dropped down the fortified walls. The king withdrew to the Potala after most of his loyal troops had been massacred. He then sent his other son Surya to fetch reinforcement in Kokonor, but the prince was captured by the invaders. Seeing that everything was lost, the king rode out from Potala in the night of 3 December 1717 with a handful of followers, desperately trying to escape. However, his horse was stuck in the mud and fell down. The fallen ruler engaged the pursuing enemy in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Eleven Dzungars fell by his hand before he was cut down. Meanwhile, a smaller Dzungar force of 300 attempted to retrieve Kelzang Gyatso from Kumbum, but was defeated by Kangxi's troops. The Dzungars, initially welcomed by the Tibetans amidst expectations that they would free them of Lha-bzang and enable the installation of Kelzang Gyatso, lost Tibetan goodwill quickly by looting Lhasa and persecuting the Nyingma.

Glenn Mullin portrays Lha-bzang Khan as a pious man who cultivated Tibetan religious authorities in every way possible, who was nevertheless rejected by the Tibetans because he was the first foreigner in almost 500 years to rule Lhasa. He is described as "a most liberal prince, very enlightened, and broad-minded in matters of religion, extremely fond of foreigners, and an administrator of rare wisdom."

# Osei Kofi Tutu I

In 1717, Osei Tutu was killed in a war against the Akyem. At the onset of the struggle, he had underestimated the Akyem because they were few in number, going into battle without his usual "magical amulets," and even leaving some of his body armor back at Kumasi, his capital. One day, as he was crossing River Pra in a canoe, he was struck by bullets from snipers and sharpshooters, who were hiding in the dense treeline. Asantehene Osei Tutu I died minutes after being shot. His last words were "Ankah me nim a" (If only I knew), an apparent reference to his having underestimated the Akyem.
Till the present day the occupant of the Golden Stool is forbidden to cross River Pra.

# Nazo Tokhi

Nazo Ana died in or about 1717 at the approximate age of 66, two years after her son's (Mirwais') death. After Nazo Ana's death, her cause was picked up by Zarghuna Ana, the mother of Afghan Emir Ahmad Shah Durrani.

# Nikita Zotov

Nikita Zotov died in December 1717 of unknown causes. Peter wasted no time in moving on, at least publicly; he replaced Zotov as "Prince-Pope" with Peter Buturlin by "electing" him on 28 December 1717, and appointing him on 10 January 1718. Peter even ordered that Zotov's widow be married to Buturlin in the fall of 1721. There was a disagreement between Konon Zotov and his stepmother over the division of Nikita Zotov's estate; Konon tried to declare Nikita's second marriage illegitimate, to avoid having to give any money to his stepmother's family.
