# Jean le Rond d'Alembert

He suffered bad health for many years and his death was as the result of a urinary bladder illness. As a known unbeliever, D'Alembert was buried in a common unmarked grave.

# John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton

On Shelburne's resignation, Dunning had several interviews with the king, who asked his advice on the formation of a new ministry. Before the act for the reform in the civil list expenditure (22 George III, c. 82) was passed, a pension of £4,000 was granted to Dunning. His health, however, had begun to give way, and he died at Exmouth a few months after the death of his eldest child, on 18 August 1783. He was buried in the parish church of Ashburton, where a monument was erected to his memory.

# John Bacon (Loyalist)

On March 31, 1783, Bacon was finally tracked down by armed forces of the new republic on Long Beach Island where he was spotted scavenging a shipwreck.  A search party of six men, led by Captain John Stewart, was sent out to find Bacon, who was found at the Rose Tavern. Stewart wrestled him to the ground before Bacon could grab his musket. Stewart stabbed Bacon with his bayonet and quickly shot him, causing his death.

Bacon's body was ceremoniously brought to Jacobstown, where the citizens were preparing a disrespectful burial in the middle of the road, when Bacon's brother arrived begging for a proper burial. His body was taken by his family to a cemetery in Arneytown.

# Charles Byrne (giant)

Byrne was living in London at the same time as the pre-eminent surgeon and anatomist John Hunter. Hunter had a reputation for collecting unusual specimens for his private museum, and Hunter had offered to pay Byrne for his corpse. As Byrne's health deteriorated, and knowing that Hunter wanted his body for dissection (a fate reserved at that time for executed criminals) and probable display, Byrne devised a plan. 
He made express arrangements with friends that when he died his body would be sealed in a lead coffin and taken to the coastal town of Margate and then to a ship for burial sea. Byrne's wishes were thwarted and his worst fears realised when Hunter (allegedly) arranged for the cadaver to be snatched on its way to Margate.  

Hunter then reduced Byrne's corpse to its skeleton and four years later put Byrne's skeleton on display in his Hunterian Museum. His 2.31-m (7 ft 7 in) skeleton was purchased in 1799 by the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London and it was then displayed for nearly two centuries.  

In 2011 calls were made in the British Medical Journal by Len Doyal, Emeritus Professor of Medical Ethics at Queen Mary, University of London, and law lecturer Thomas Muinzer to put an end to the unethical display of Byrne's skeleton at the museum and for it to be buried at sea "as Byrne intended for himself". The article argued that Byrne's DNA had been taken and could be used in further research, but that it was now time to respect Byrne's burial wishes and attempt to morally rectify what happened.

A public poll conducted on the BMJ's website over December 2011—January 2012 in response to the article "Should the Skeleton of 'the Irish Giant' Be Buried at Sea?" by Doyal and Muinzer offered people the chance to vote on what they thought should happen to Byrne's remains. Doyal and Muinzer reported: "On the last count that we saw before voting ceased, 55.6% (310) voted for burial at sea; 13.17% (74) for removal from display and being kept for research; and 31.55% (176) for the status quo."

The BMJ article was widely reported and the resulting swell of public support for the campaign forced The Royal College of Surgeons to formally consider whether it should release Byrne's skeleton, the showpiece of their Hunterian museum, in February 2012. They decided to continue the exhibit.

Since then, a further academic article has been published in the International Journal of Culture and Property Law which deals with the legal issues raised by the display of Byrne's skeleton and contains new fieldwork carried out in Byrne's native townland of Littlebridge. The article again calls for the release of Byrne's skeleton from his captor's museum on moral grounds and for a burial to be carried out in Byrne's homeland at, or as near as possible to, the Giant's Grave, a local site where folk tradition suggests Byrne wished to be buried. The article explains that as the legal system stands, people have no legal power to direct what will happen to their remains following death, and so rely on their loved ones to carry out their burial wishes so that they are buried with respect and dignity.

In May 2015, the then Mayor of Derry Martin Reilly wrote to the Museum's trustees advocating for "the importance of respecting the wishes of Mr Byrne in relation to his burial". In March 2017, Dr. Thomas Muinzer appeared in an interview on the NPR program All Things Considered for a piece entitled "The saga of the Irish Giant's Bones dismays Medical Ethicists." A Change.org petition started by Richard Mckee of Oregon in the United States to honor the dying wishes of Charles Byrne to be buried at sea has so far garnered 456 signatures.[citation needed]

On 6 June 2018, speaking on behalf of the campaign, Dr Thomas Muinzer published an article in The Conversation entitled "Why a London museum should return the stolen bones of an Irish giant"  as a result of recent developments with the case.

Following renewed pressure from campaigners, The Guardian reported in an article entitled "'Irish giant' may finally get respectful burial after 200 years on display" that the Trustees of the Hunterian Museum have confirmed that they will consider whether to release the skeleton of  Charles Byrne for burial; a spokesperson for the Royal College of Surgeons said “The Hunterian Museum will be closed [from late 2016] until 2021 and Charles Byrne’s skeleton is not currently on display. The board of trustees of the Hunterian collection will be discussing the matter during the period of closure of the museum.” 

Carla Valentine, technical curator of the Pathology Museum at Queen Mary University, London has said: “Now that it’s out there that they’re considering this, I think it will be difficult to go back from that.”

# Eyre Coote (East India Company officer)

In 1782, Coote relinquished his command, and moved to Calcutta. However amid increasing French harassment, and ruptures between the governor and new commander in chief, Hastings persuaded Coote to return to his command. He died of a stroke soon after returning to Madras on 28 April 1783.

# Leonhard Euler

In 1760, with the Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by advancing Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid compensation for the damage caused to Euler's estate, later Empress Elizabeth of Russia added a further payment of 4000 roubles—an exorbitant amount at the time. The political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant—a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent the rest of his life in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.

Three years after his wife's death, Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell (1723–1794). This marriage lasted until his death. In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 

In St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, Euler was discussing the newly discovered planet Uranus and its orbit with a fellow academician Anders Johan Lexell, when he collapsed from a brain hemorrhage. He died a few hours later. Jacob von Staehlin-Storcksburg wrote a short obituary for the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian mathematician Nicolas Fuss, one of Euler's disciples, wrote a more detailed eulogy, which he delivered at a memorial meeting. In his eulogy for the French Academy, French mathematician and philosopher Marquis de Condorcet, wrote:

Euler was buried next to Katharina at the Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery on Goloday Island. In 1785, the Russian Academy of Sciences put a marble bust of Leonhard Euler on a pedestal next to the Director's seat and, in 1837, placed a headstone on Euler's grave. To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Euler's birth, the headstone was moved in 1956, together with his remains, to the 18th-century necropolis at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery.

# Timothy Foster (settler)

On April 1, 1785, Timothy Foster was struck by a tree limb which fractured his skull and rendered him unconscious. His son Stuart Foster and two neighbors walked to Falmouth, Maine, for a surgeon. The surgeon could not return with them, but he gave them a trephine—a saw to bore a hole in Foster's skull. The men did not return in time to save him[b] and he died April 3, 1785.

A new home was built for the widow Foster by her sons, which still stands. Outside her home the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a memorial plaque on a stone that honors Timothy Foster as a patriot and the first settler of Winthrop.

# Bernard Gates

In 1737 (10 March) Mrs. Gates died, and in 1758 Gates moved to North Aston, Oxfordshire. He died there on 15 November 1773, and was buried in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey on the 23rd of the month. The inscription on his monument, a source for his family information, gives his age as eighty-eight. A tablet to his memory was put up in the church of North Aston, at the expense of his pupil, Thomas Sanders Dupuis.

# Marguerite Gourdan

Gourdan was made bankrupt in May 1778. On November 28 that year, Marguerite Gourdan died in a bedroom on the first floor of her home on the rue Dussoubs. Her death was caused by complications of syphilis.

A song was composed about her funeral:

A collection of letters between Gourdan and her clients, called Correspondance de Madame Gourdan, dite la petite comtesse was published in 1883.

# Sir Allan Maclean, 6th Baronet

Sir Allan entertained Samuel Johnson and James Boswell on Inch Kenneth in October 1773. Allan Maclean died in 1783 or 1784 without a son and his title went to a fourth cousin, Sir Hector Maclean, 7th Baronet.

# Prince Octavius of Great Britain

Six months after Alfred's death, Octavius and Sophia were taken to Kew Palace in London to be inoculated with the smallpox virus. While Sophia recovered without incident, Octavius became ill and died several days later, around 8 o'clock PM, on 3 May 1783, at Kew Palace. He was four years old. As was traditional, the household did not go into mourning for the deaths of royal children under the age of fourteen.

Octavius has the distinction of being the last member of the British royal family to suffer from smallpox. On 10 May, he was buried alongside his brother Alfred at Westminster Abbey. Their eldest brother, when King George IV, ordered their remains transferred to St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 11 February 1820, at about 3 o'clock.

According to Queen Charlotte, Octavius's death was unexpected; she wrote to a friend who faced a similar tragedy that "twice have I felt what you do feel, the last time without the least preparation for such a stroke, for in less than eight and forty hours was my son Octavius, in perfect health, sick and struck with death immediately." The prince's death had a marked effect, both mentally and physically on Queen Charlotte, who at the time was pregnant with her youngest child, Princess Amelia.

Octavius's death devastated his father; Walpole wrote "the King has lost another little child; a lovely boy, they say, of whom their Majesties were dotingly fond." Shortly afterward, King George said "There will be no Heaven for me if Octavius is not there." The day after his son's death, the King passed through a room where artist Thomas Gainsborough was completing the finishing touches on a portrait of the family. The King asked him to stop, but when he found out that the painting was of Octavius, allowed the painter to continue. When this same painting was exhibited a week later, Octavius's sisters were so upset that they broke down and cried in front of everyone. Three months after Octavius's death, his father was still dwelling on his son, writing to Lord Dartmouth that every day "increases the chasm I feel for want of that beloved object [Octavius]." In later years, King George imagined conversations with his two youngest sons. During one of the king's bouts of madness in 1788, George mistook a pillow for Octavius, who by that time had been dead for five years.

# Grigory Orlov

In 1777, at the age of 43, he married his 18-year-old relative, Catherine Zinovyeva, variously described by sources as either a niece or a cousin, but left no children by that marriage. Catherine died of tuberculosis in 1781, at the age of 23, in Lausanne (Switzerland). Her tomb, from which her body was removed in 1910, still remains in cathedrale Notre-Dame in Lausanne.

For some time before his death, he suffered from a serious mental illness, probably a form of dementia, which progressed towards complete mental collapse. After his death, Catherine wrote, "Although I have long been prepared for this sad event, it has nevertheless shaken me to the depths of my being. People may console me, I may even repeat to myself all those things which it is customary to say on such occasions--my only answer is strangled tears. I suffer intolerably."

# James Otis Jr.

Otis died suddenly in May 1783 at age 58, struck by lightning as he stood in the doorway of a friend's house. He is reported to have said to his sister Mercy Otis Warren, "My dear sister, I hope, when God Almighty in his righteous providence shall take me out of time into eternity that it will be by a flash of lightning".[failed verification]

# Raghunathrao

Raghunathrao Bajirao died on 11 December 1783 of unknown causes. He had two sons Baji Rao II and Chimaji Rao II; in addition, he had adopted Amrit Rao.  After his death, his wife Anandi Bai and his three sons were kept in confinement by the Peshwa's minister Nana Fadnavis. After the death of Peshwa Madhav Rao II, Nana Phadnavis and the powerful chief Daulat Rao Scindia installed Chimaji Rao and Baji Rao II as puppet Peshwas in quick succession.

# Anna Williams (poet)

As Williams grew old and frail she became more and more intolerant towards other members of the household, although this did not affect Johnson's care for her. He wrote a prayer for her in her last illness, and after her death wrote, "Her curiosity was universal, her knowledge was very extensive, and she sustained forty years of misery with steady fortitude. Thirty years and more she has been my companion, and her death has left me very desolate." His circle, while noting her peevishness, also acknowledged her learning and intelligence. She left £200 in stocks at her death, and £157.14s. in cash to the Ladies' Charity School, Snow Hill, London.
