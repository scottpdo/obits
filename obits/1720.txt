# Theobald Butler (solicitor-general)

He died in March 1720 and was buried in the churchyard of St James' Church in Dublin city. His burial in a Protestant churchyard may simply  be a tribute to his universal popularity;  on the other hand  it may be  evidence that he did occasionally  attend Church of Ireland services.  His memorial, which still exists, and was restored by his descendants in the 1870s, has a Latin  inscription by his eldest son James praising "the best of fathers".

This high opinion of Butler  seems to have been generally shared: Jonathan Swift called him a man who was "universally beloved".

# Calico Jack

In September 1720, the Bahamas' Governor Woodes Rogers had issued a proclamation declaring Rackham and his crew pirates—although it was not published until October 1720. After publication of the warrant, pirate hunter Jonathan Barnet and former pirate Jean Bonadvis started in pursuit of Rackham, who was cruising near Jamaica capturing numerous small fishing vessels and terrorizing fishermen along the northern Jamaican coastline.

Rackham had come across a small vessel crewed by nine English pirates, and they joined Rackham on his ship for a bout of drinking while at anchor, during which they became intoxicated at Dry Harbour Bay in Jamaica, October 1720. Barnet's sloop attacked Rackham's ship and captured it after a fight presumably led by Mary Read and Anne Bonny. Rackham and his crew were brought to Spanish Town, Jamaica, in November 1720, where they were tried and convicted of piracy and sentenced to be hanged.

Rackham was executed in Port Royal on 18 November 1720, his body then gibbeted on display on a very small islet at a main entrance to Port Royal now known as Rackham's Cay.

# Charles Carroll the Settler

In 1715, political power over the Maryland colony was restored to the Calvert family after the conversion of Benedict Calvert to Protestantism. Emboldened by this turn of events, and with support from a number of prominent Maryland Catholic families, Carroll attempted to gain government office in the state. This would have been a profound departure from the policy of excluding Catholics from government, which had existed since the Protestant takeover in 1689. Carroll's chief antagonist in this effort was the Governor, John Hart. In 1716, Hart discovered that Carroll was planning to travel to England to lobby Calvert's officials for restoration of office-holding rights for Catholics, something Hart vehemently opposed. Hart described Carroll as:

Carroll travelled to England to press his case, although Hart later claimed that he had been promised no such lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent in the colony. He was further appointed to the positions of receiver general, escheator, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money in the colony that was collected by the government or by Calvert's private organization.

Upon Carroll's return to Maryland, Hart was incensed both at the threat to his own power and the idea of a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration confirming the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined when he came to the defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.

Carroll died only two years later, with his wealth intact but having failed to regain any political rights for Catholics in Maryland. Carroll's eldest son Henry had died a year before; the family fortune and burden of heading a Catholic family in Protestant-dominated Maryland were passed on to his younger sons Charles and Daniel.

Carroll's descendants continued to play a prominent role in the colony. His son Charles, known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, maintained and expanded the family fortune. His grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, achieved the restoration of political rights his grandfather had desired. He became the only Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence.

# George Dodington (died 1720)

Dodington died on 28 March 1720 and left his estate to his nephew George Bubb, who assumed the surname of Dodington and commissioned the building of Eastbury Park.

# David Gregory (physician)

Aided by an Aberdeen watchmaker, Gregory began designing a military cannon and showed the prototype to his son David. The model was then passed to Isaac Newton. The model was destroyed on Newton's advice and Gregory's grandson, Thomas Reid, reported that Newton had considered it to be "destructive to the human species". No records or details of the model have been found by historians.

To avoid the troubles of the Jacobite Rebellion, Gregory and his family went back to the Netherlands in 1715. They returned to Aberdeen a few years later. Gregory then worked on writing a journal but it was not published. He died aged ninety-five years in 1720.

# Sir Willoughby Hickman, 3rd Baronet

Hickman died on 28 October 1720. He and his wife Anne had six daughters and five sons of whom two survived. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Nevile.

# Isaac Milles

He died of paralysis on 6 July 1720, and was buried on 9 July in the chancel of Highclere Church, where a black marble slab with a Latin inscription was put up to his memory by his children.  A white marble monument with inscription was also placed by his eldest son on the north wall of the chancel.  Bromley mentions a rare engraved portrait of him, signed by George Vertue.

# Muhanna bin Sultan

However, the public still favored Saif bin Sultan II, and were stirred up by Ya'Arab bin Bel'Arab, his cousin. 
Ya'Arab raised forces and marched on Muscat, which he took. He then turned towards Rustaq. As he advanced, Muhanna's supported deserted him.
Muhanna tried to find safety in the fort at Rustaq. He was offered protection if he left. 
When he accepted, he was captured, thrown in prison and then murdered.
He died around the end of 1720.
This began a period of violent tribal hostilities.
Ya'Arab bin Bel'Arab re-installed Saif bin Sultan II  and declared himself regent during the minority of his cousin.
In May 1722 Ya'Arab took the next step and proclaimed himself Imam.

# Nawab Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan Barha

He was eventually assassinated by Turkish nobles also known as the Turani faction. On the pretext of presenting a petition concerning his malnourished troops, Haider Beg Dughlat fatally stabbed Hussain Ali Khan as his attention was diverted to reading the petition. Haider Beg Dughlat was immediately killed by Hussain Ali Khan's fourteen year old nephew Sayyid Nurallah Khan (Sayyid Nur Ali) who was himself immediately killed by Mughal troops. According to the historian Khizr Khan, Hussain Ali Khan was buried in his fathers tomb at Ajmer.

# Sir Gregory Page, 1st Baronet

Page died on 25 May 1720, and was buried at Greenwich on 2 June 1720. He left four children: two sons (Gregory and Thomas) and two daughters (Mary and Sophia).  The baronetcy and his "immense fortune" was inherited by his eldest son, Gregory. His widow died at Greenwich on 4 March 1729 aged 56. She was buried in a vault at Bunhill Fields on the outskirts of the City of London. Her epitaph hinted at a painful illness, which was possibly Meigs' syndrome. The epitaph reads in part:

# Alexander Rose

He died on 20 March 1720 of apoplexy, and was buried in the grounds of Restalrig church. He married once, to a woman named Euphan, the daughter of the provost of Perth, Patrick Threipland of Fingask. His son John Rose fought in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715, and was captured at the battle of Sheriffmuir, though he obtained clemency partly due to his father's influence.

# Francis Rose (Jamaica)

Rose died on 20 November 1720. He was buried at Saint Catherine Parish Church (Spanish Town Cathedral) where a monumental inscription notes his death in his 67th year. Other inscriptions nearby note the burial of his son Thomas and of other family members as well as family connections to Francis Price who served as a captain in the British Army under Venables during the capture of Jamaica from the Spanish in 1655 and Lieutenant Colonel "Rose, also one of the conquerors of that Island, and the scion of an ancient family long settled in the counties of Dorset, and Gloucester."

# Gregorio de Salinas Varona

Gregorio de Salinas Varona died in 1720 or shortly after that date in Mexico City.

# Erdmuthe Dorothea of Saxe-Zeitz

She died in 1720 on her widow seat Bündorf Castle and was buried in the ducal crypt in Merseburg Cathedral.

On the occasion of her death a gold  ducat coin was minted.  One of the four obelisks in the garden of Merseburg Castle is dedicated to her memory.

# Peter Tordenskjold

Tordenskiold did not long survive the termination of the war. On 12 November 1720, at the age of 30, he was killed in a duel by Livonian colonel Jakob Axel Staël von Holstein. During a trip to Hannover, Tordenskiold got in a fight with von Holstein, who had been in Swedish military service. The confrontation ended in a duel on the Sehlwiese in Gleidingen near Hildesheim, in which Tordenskiold was run through by the sword of von Holstein. The circumstances around the death of Tordenskiold was set in a conspirational light, as summed up in the contemporary three volume Tordenskiold biography (1747–1750) by C. P. Rothe.

The duel was encouraged by a dispute with von Holstein, whom Tordenskiold offended by labeling him as a cheat at gambling. At a dinner party, Tordenskiold told of a friend who had been cheated while gambling with a man who claimed to own a Hydra, to which von Holstein announced he was the owner of the said creature and took offence at being called a cheat. This dispute turned into a fight, in which von Holstein unsuccessfully tried to pull a sword, after which Tordenskiold used the pommel of his own sword to beat him up. von Holstein demanded satisfaction through a duel.
The details of the duel - beside it ending with Tordenskiolds death by a single wound by von Holsteins sword - is not well known. 


His corpse was brought to Copenhagen to the Church of Holmen without much ceremony, as duelling was not allowed according to Danish law of the time. In 1819, he was a buried in a sarcophagus.

# Balaji Vishwanath

Balaji returned in triumph from Delhi to Satara, having also secured the release after decades of Mughal captivity, the mother (Yesubai), wife (Savitribai) and half-brother (Madan Singh) of Shahu.  Weary from his labors and the tiresome journey back from the imperial capital, Balaji Vishwanath's health began to fail.  In October 1719 he obtained leave from Shahu to retire to the village of Saswad near Pune that had been granted by Shahu to the Peshwa. Balaji Vishwanath died on 12 April 1720. He was succeeded by his elder son, the celebrated Baji Rao I, who was appointed Peshwa by Chattrapati Shahu..
