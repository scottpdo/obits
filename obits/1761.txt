# Ananda Ranga Pillai

Pillai's health worsened with the passage of time. However, he notes in his diary, the corruption and intrigues which allegedly plagued the French colony on Dupleix's departure.

Pillai died on 12 January 1761 at the age of 51, just four days before Pondicherry surrendered to the troops of Colonel Coote. Pillai left behind three daughters. He also had two sons Annasamy and Ayyasamy who predeceased him.

Since the discovery and translation of his diaries during the 19th and early 20th centuries, Ananda Ranga Pillai has accumulated a great deal of posthumous fame and recognition for his depiction of 18th century South India, the intrigues and deals in French Pondicherry and his description of the French conquest of Madras and the Carnatic Wars. His set of diaries have emerged as one of our primary sources of reference on the Carnatic Wars. Ananda Ranga Pillai has been referred to by V. V. S. Aiyar in his journal Balabharati and had attracted the curiosity of Subrahmanya Bharati, Aurobindo Ghosh and Mandyam Srinivasa Iyengar. C. S. Srinivasachari, a prominent Indian historian, described Ananda Ranga Pillai as "the Samuel Pepys of French India".

Ananda Ranga Pillai traded in cloth, yarn, indigo and arecanut with Manila, Mocha and Mascareigne. He had his own ship, Anandappuravi, which sailed on long trading voyages on high seas.

Ananda Ranga Pillai's house in Pondicherry, which is located in a street named after the dubash,  was one of the few buildings to survive the British invasion of the city in 1761.  It  was recently recognized as a heritage monument by the Government of Puducherry. The mansion is known for its unique blend of Indian and French architecture: the ground floor being built in Indian fashion, while the columns which supported the terrace followed the French architectural style.

A diary maintained by Muthu Vijaya Tiruvengadam Pillai, grandson of Ananda Ranga Pillai, related the period from 1794 to 1796 was  translated and published on 30 March 2000.

# Sadashivrao Bhau

  Ahmad Shah Durrani and his coalition decisively defeat the Maratha Confederacy, during the Third Battle of Panipat.


Bhau, on seeing the demise of his beloved Vishwasrao, Bhausaheb came down from his elephant, climbed on a horse and plunged into the enemy lines, without realizing the consequences. Seeing his empty howda, his troops thought that he had fallen and that they were leaderless and caused confusion. However, Bhau didn't leave the battlefield and was killed.

His headless body was found in the heap of dead bodies three days after the war. It was identified by the Maratha Vakil who were with the camp of left Marathas with Kashiraj Pandit, the wazir of Shuja Ud Daula. Bhau's body was cremated with all rituals. The next day, his head was found, which was kept hidden by an Afghan soldier. It was cremated and the ashes taken for visarjan to Kashi (Vishwas Patil, Kashiraj Pandit bakhar).

# Edward Boscawen

Boscawen returned to England where he was promoted General of Marines in recognition of his service. He was given the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh. Admiral Boscawen returned to sea for the final time and took his station off the west coast of France around Quiberon Bay. After a violent attack of what was later diagnosed as Typhoid fever the Admiral came ashore where, on 10 January 1761, he died at his home in Hatchlands Park in Surrey. His body was taken to St. Michael's Church, St Michael Penkevil, Cornwall, where he was buried. The monument at the church begins:



Here lies the Right HonourableEdward Boscawen,Admiral of the Blue, General of Marines,Lord of the Admiralty, and one of hisMajesty's most Honourable Privy Council.His birth, though noble,His titles, though illustrious,Were but incidental additions to his greatness.:211


William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham and Prime Minister once said to Boscawen: "When I apply to other Officers respecting any expedition I may chance to project, they always raise difficulties, you always find expedients.":289

# Henry Campion

Campion died on 17 April 1761 and was buried at Hurstpierpoint.  He left a son, William and a daughter, Katherine, who had married a George Courthope.

# Archduke Charles Joseph of Austria (1745–1761)

The rivalry between the brothers was ended by Charles Joseph's death from smallpox, two weeks before his sixteenth birthday. While his mother was sitting by his bed in tears, Charles Joseph told her:



You should not weep for me, dear mother, for had I lived, I would have brought you many more tears!


Charles Joseph is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. His heart was buried separately in the Habsburg Crypt in the Loreto chapel of the Augustinian Church in Vienna.

# Samuel Davies (clergyman)

Davies's own term as president also proved short—he died in 1761 at the age of 37. His final published sermon was eerily entitled "This Very Year You Shall Die!" and delivered at Princeton on New Year's Day, 1761. Davies preached using Jeremiah 28:16 as his reference text, proclaiming that "it is not only possible--but highly probable, that death may meet some of us within the compass of this year." Almost prophetically, Davies died one month later from pneumonia, on February 4, 1761. Rev. Finley succeeded him as the school's president, and Davies was buried alongside his predecessor in Princeton Cemetery.

# Jane Douglas

Around 1746, her fortunes took a turn for the worse. Her house fell out of fashion with high society and a lower class of customer began to patronise the establishment. Douglas herself became pregnant; the child was thought to be Lord Fitzwilliam's and was the subject of much debate, although Rear Admiral Charles Holmes, another of Douglas' lovers, later turned out to be the father. Additionally, Douglas' health was beginning to fail.

By 1759, she was unable to continue business, and the lease on the King's Head passed to a relative, Amelia Douglas. Jane was described as "much bloated by Drink and Debauch...her Legs swelled out of shape...suffering great discomfort". She died on 10 June 1761 leaving a considerable estate. The contents of her house were sold off by her friend, the auctioneer, Abraham Langford. Although there was a genuine Mother Cole, Douglas supposedly forms the prototype for Mother Cole in John Cleland's Fanny Hill, and together with Langford, those of Mrs. Cole and Mr. Smirk in Samuel Foote's The Mirror.

# Crisp Gascoyne

Gascoyne died on 28 December 1761, and was buried on 4 January 1762 in Barking Church, in the north aisle of which is a large monument with an inscription, erected to his memory by his four children. His will, dated 20 December 1761, was proved in the P.C.C. 4 January 1762 (St. Eloy, 13).

He married Margaret, daughter and co-heiress of Dr. John Bamber, a wealthy physician of Mincing Lane, who purchased large estates in Essex and built the mansion of Bifrons at Barking. A drawing of this house as it appeared in 1794 is preserved in the Guildhall Library copy of Daniel Lysons's Environs (vol. iv. pt. i. p. 88). Gascoyne had four surviving children—Bamber, Joseph, Ann and Margaret. His wife was buried in Barking Church 10 October 1740.

Dr. Bamber died in November 1753, and his property descended in entail to Bamber Gascoyne (1725–1791), the eldest son. Bamber Gascoyne entered Queen's College, Oxford (1743); was barrister of Lincoln's Inn (1750); was M.P. for Malden 1761–63, Midhurst 1765–70, Weobly 1770–1774, Truro 1774–1784, and Bossiney 1784–1786; and was also receiver-general of customs and a lord of the admiralty. On his death in 1791 the Bamber estates descended to his son Bamber (1758–1824), M.P. for Liverpool 1780–96, who cut off the entail, pulled down the house of Bifrons, and sold the site and park. His daughter and heiress married the second Marquis of Salisbury, who took the name of Gascoyne before that of Cecil, and became possessed of the Bamber property, worth, it is said, £12000 a year (Munk's Roll). Their son was Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, three times prime minister.

A mezzotint portrait of Crisp Gascoyne by James McArdell, from a painting by William Keable, was published in the London Magazine for July 1753. There is a smaller and anonymous print, probably of the same date.

# William Home, 8th Earl of Home

He was meant to return to England on 29 April 1761 but he died the day before in Gibraltar. His younger brother Alexander succeeded him as Earl. Despite the separation, his wife Elizabeth retained her title and remained independently wealthy due to her father and first husband until her death in 1784. She was buried in Westminster Abbey.

The UK Government has a painting of Major General William Home in its collection attributed to the British school of painters.

# Ibrahim Khan Gardi

Ibrahim Khan was caught by Afghans while performing last rites of his master Sadashivrao Bhau and Vishwasrao Bhat. Ibrahim Khan was tortured to death by Najib-ud-daula and his Rohilla men[citation needed] as revenge for serving the Marathas.

Ibrahim Khan's loyalty to his master as well as courage to stand upfront against invaders distinguishes him from others and makes him memorable in folklore and songs in the Deccan region.

# Panah Ali Khan

When Karīm Khan Zand took control of much of Iran, he forced Panāh Khan to come to Shiraz (Capital), where he died as a hostage. Panah-Ali Khan's son Ibrahim-Khalil Khan was sent back to Karabakh as governor. Ibrahim, succeeding his father (1760), not only ruled over most of Qarābāḡ, but also became one of the major potentates in the Caucasus.

# Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1751–1761)

  The Duke of Burgundy and his mother, by Quentin de La Tour, 1761.


The young Duke was pushed off a wooden horse by one of his playmates in 1759. As he was recognized for his kindness, he did not tell anyone about this, in order to prevent his friend from getting into any trouble. After this incident, the Duke of Burgundy's health started to deteriorate quickly. The family's physician, Dr. Barbier, decided to operate on him in 1760. The Duke was operated on while he was conscious. Knowing that he would die, the Dauphin had him baptised on 29 November 1760, with Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska, his grandparents, as his godparents. Until that moment, he had been known just as "Burgundy". By 1761, the Duke was bound to his bed, unable to move his legs, with what was diagnosed as extra pulmonary tuberculosis of the bone. He would later die from this disease, on 22 March 1761.

# Makhdoom Muhammad Hashim Thattvi

Makhdoom Hashim's urs is celebrated every year on the 6th of rajab at the shrine.

The day's proceedings involve recitation of the Quran, hymns and praises of Allah and Muhammad and the Prophet, and religious discourses are given by local orators and scholars.

# Balaji Baji Rao

  The samadhi of Peshwa Nana Saheb


The defeat at Panipat resulted in heavy losses for the Marathas, and was a huge setback for Peshwa Balaji Rao. He received the news of the defeat of Panipat on 24 January 1761 at Bhilsa, while leading a reinforcement force. Besides several important generals, he had lost his own son Vishwasrao in the Battle of Panipat. He died on 23 June 1761, and was succeeded by his younger son Madhav Rao I.

# Samuel Richardson

  Bust of Richardson


In his final years, Richardson received visits from Archbishop Secker, other important political figures, and many London writers.:170 By that time, he enjoyed a high social position and was Master of the Stationers' Company.:170 In early November 1754, Richardson and his family moved from the Grange to a home at Parsons Green.:170 It was during this time that Richardson received a letter from Samuel Johnson asking for money to pay for a debt that Johnson was unable to afford.:177 On 16 March 1756, Richardson responded with more than enough money, and their friendship was certain by this time.:177

At the same time as he was associating with important figures of the day, Richardson's career as a novelist drew to a close.:178 Grandison was his final novel, and he stopped writing fiction afterwards.:178 It was Grandison that set the tone for Richardson's followers after his death. However, he was continually prompted by various friends and admirers to continue to write along with suggested topics.:178 Richardson did not like any of the topics, and chose to spend all of his time composing letters to his friends and associates.:178 The only major work that Richardson would write would be A Collection of the Moral and Instruction Sentiments, Maxims, Cautions, and Reflexions, contained in the Histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison.:183 Although it is possible that this work was inspired by Johnson asking for an "index rerum" for Richardson's novels, the Collection contains more of a focus on "moral and instructive" lessons than the index that Johnson sought.:183

After June 1758, Richardson began to suffer from insomnia, and in June 1761, he was afflicted with apoplexy.:186 This moment was described by his friend, Miss Talbot, on 2 July 1761:




Poor Mr. Richardson was seized on Sunday evening with a most severe paralytic stroke.... It sits pleasantly upon my mind, that the last morning we spent together was particularly friendly, and quiet, and comfortable. It was the 28th of May – he looked then so well! One has long apprehended some stroke of this kind; the disease made its gradual approaches by that heaviness which clouded the cheerfulness of his conversation, that used to be so lively and so instructive; by the increased tremblings which unfitted that hand so peculiarly formed to guide the pen; and by, perhaps, the querulousness of temper, most certainly not natural to so sweet and so enlarged a mind, which you and I have lately lamented, as making his family at times not so comfortable as his principles, his study, and his delight to diffuse happiness, wherever he could, would otherwise have done:186–7



Two days later, aged 71, on 4 July 1761, Richardson died at Parsons Green and was buried at St. Bride's Church in Fleet Street near his first wife Martha.:187

During Richardson's life, his printing press produced about 10,000 pieces, including novels, historical texts, Acts of Parliament, and newspapers, making his print house one of the most productive and diverse in the 18th century. He wanted to keep the press in his family, but after the death of his four sons and a nephew, his printing press would be left in his will to his only surviving male heir, a second nephew.:2 This happened to be a nephew whom Richardson did not trust, doubting his abilities as a printer.:2 Richardson's fears proved well-founded, for after his death the press stopped producing quality works and eventually stopped printing altogether.:2 Richardson owned copyrights to most of his works, and these were sold after his death,:90 in twenty-fourth share issues, with shares in Clarissa bringing in 25 pounds each and those for Grandison bringing in 20 pounds each. Shares in Pamela, sold in sixteenths, went for 18 pounds each.:90

# Nicholas Scull II

He died in 1761 and was buried in Whitemarsh Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Scull's 1752 map of Philadelphia was adapted and republished by William Faden in London in 1777 during the American Revolution.

# John Taylor (dissenting preacher)

Taylor died in his sleep on 5 March 1761, and was buried in the chapel-yard at Chowbent, Lancashire. His funeral sermon was preached by Edward Harwood. A tablet to his memory is in Chowbent Chapel; another in the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, bearing a Latin inscription by Samuel Parr.
