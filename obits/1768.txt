# Thomas Bacon (priest)

Bacon died in Frederick on 24 May 1768, leaving his widow Elizabeth and three daughters (Rachel, Elizabeth, and Mary). His three slaves (a boy, woman and child), were together valued by the probate court at 100 pounds. His daughter Elizabeth moved to England to become a servant to his brother Anthony's wife, and both Rachel and Mary ultimately married and remained in the colony.

Bacon's abridgement of the Laws of Maryland, begun in Talbot county in 1753, became celebrated. The Lord Proprietor, who originally subscribed to 100 pounds, gave the cleric a gold snuff box, which was noted in the inventory of his estate.

His clerical successor, Bennet Allen became the subject of scandal, and locked out of the parish, so he, like Rev. Bacon, hired a curate to handle spiritual duties in the huge parish, which was divided after the American Revolutionary War.

In 1813, Virginian William Meade (who would become the Episcopal Bishop of Virginia) published a collection of pro-slavery essays, including some by Bacon. Like Bacon, Meade attempted to justify both the education of African Americans to slaveowners (who preferred illiteracy) as well as slavery (emphasizing the "organic ties" between rich and poor, powerful and powerless who all were to fulfill the responsibilities associated with their particular station in life).

While both St. Peter's parish and All Saints Church still exist today, Bacon's gravesite was lost as Frederick grew, although it may be under the present city hall and surrounding park, for All Saints' graveyard was moved to the outskirts and consolidated in Mount Olivet cemetery in 1852.

He married secondly Mary Ward; their daughter, Jane Margaret, married the English judge Sir Edward Vaughan Williams  in 1826 and they were the grandparents of the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.

# James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres

He died on 20 February 1768 at age 76 at Balcarres, Fife, Scotland, where he was buried. His title was inherited by his eldest son Alexande Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres.

# John Bristow

Bristow died in Portugal on 14 November 1768 leaving four sons and eleven daughters. His daughter Caroline married William Henry Lyttleton, MP. His daughter, Frances, married Richard Neave later Governor of the Bank of England. Another daughter, Harriot Elizabeth Slessor, who married an army officer stationed in Portugal, is an ancestor of actress Olivia Colman.

Bristow had acquired Quidenham Hall after 1740 and added an East Wing in Palladian style and a West portico supported by large Doric columns. 

Bristow's brother Robert Bristow (1688–1737) and his nephew Robert Bristow (1712–1776) were both MPs for Winchelsea, which had been his father's seat.

# Pierre Simon Fournier

Fournier's company remained open until the 19th century.

Interest in type design was stimulated in 1922 by D. B. Updike's Printing Types. This led to the newly appointed advisor to the Monotype Corporation, Stanley Morison, initiating a program of recutting past faces. Among them was Fournier's self-named font.

# Charles Gore (MP)

Gore died on 15 February 1768 leaving three sons and five daughters. He was the brother of Lieutenant-Colonel John Gore.

# Mary Hervey

She died on 2 September 1768, aged 68, and was buried at Ickworth, Suffolk. The epitaph on her tombstone was written by Horace Walpole.

Lady Hervey was a lively and intelligent letter writer. Her letters to the Rev. Edmund Morris, formerly tutor to her sons, written between 1742 and 1768, were published in 1821. Several earlier letters of hers written to the Countess of Suffolk are in the two volumes of Lady Suffolk's Letters, 1824.

Two portraits of Lady Hervey are in the possession of the National Trust at Ickworth. Another, formerly belonging to the Strawberry Hill collection, painted by Allan Ramsay, was lent by Lord Lifford[which?] to the Exhibition of National Portraits at South Kensington in 1867. An engraving from a miniature, also formerly at Strawberry Hill, is in Walpole's Letters.
