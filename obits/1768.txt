# Thomas Bacon (priest)

Bacon died in Frederick on 24 May 1768, leaving his widow Elizabeth and three daughters (Rachel, Elizabeth, and Mary). His three slaves (a boy, woman and child), were together valued by the probate court at 100 pounds. His daughter Elizabeth moved to England to become a servant to his brother Anthony's wife, and both Rachel and Mary ultimately married and remained in the colony.

Bacon's abridgement of the Laws of Maryland, begun in Talbot county in 1753, became celebrated. The Lord Proprietor, who originally subscribed to 100 pounds, gave the cleric a gold snuff box, which was noted in the inventory of his estate.

His clerical successor, Bennet Allen became the subject of scandal, and locked out of the parish, so he, like Rev. Bacon, hired a curate to handle spiritual duties in the huge parish, which was divided after the American Revolutionary War.

In 1813, Virginian William Meade (who would become the Episcopal Bishop of Virginia) published a collection of pro-slavery essays, including some by Bacon. Like Bacon, Meade attempted to justify both the education of African Americans to slaveowners (who preferred illiteracy) as well as slavery (emphasizing the "organic ties" between rich and poor, powerful and powerless who all were to fulfill the responsibilities associated with their particular station in life).

While both St. Peter's parish and All Saints Church still exist today, Bacon's gravesite was lost as Frederick grew, although it may be under the present city hall and surrounding park, for All Saints' graveyard was moved to the outskirts and consolidated in Mount Olivet cemetery in 1852.

# Sir Walter Bagot, 5th Baronet

Bagot  died on 20 January 1768, leaving by his wife Barbara,  eight sons and eight daughters. Their children included:

# James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres

He died on 20 February 1768 at age 76 at Balcarres, Fife, Scotland, where he was buried. His title was inherited by his eldest son Alexande Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres.

# John Bristow

Bristow died in Portugal on 14 November 1768 leaving four sons and eleven daughters. His daughter Caroline married William Henry Lyttleton, MP. His daughter, Frances, married Richard Neave later Governor of the Bank of England. Another daughter, Harriot Elizabeth Slessor, who married an army officer stationed in Portugal, is an ancestor of actress Olivia Colman.

Bristow had acquired Quidenham Hall after 1740 and added an East Wing in Palladian style and a West portico supported by large Doric columns. 

Bristow's brother Robert Bristow (1688–1737) and his nephew Robert Bristow (1712–1776) were both MPs for Winchelsea, which had been his father's seat.

# Pierre Simon Fournier

Fournier's company remained open until the 19th century.

Interest in type design was stimulated in 1922 by D. B. Updike's Printing Types. This led to the newly appointed advisor to the Monotype Corporation, Stanley Morison, initiating a program of recutting past faces. Among them was Fournier's self-named font.

# Charles Gore (MP)

Gore died on 15 February 1768 leaving three sons and five daughters. He was the brother of Lieutenant-Colonel John Gore.

# Mary Hervey

She died on 2 September 1768, aged 68, and was buried at Ickworth, Suffolk. The epitaph on her tombstone was written by Horace Walpole.

Lady Hervey was a lively and intelligent letter writer. Her letters to the Rev. Edmund Morris, formerly tutor to her sons, written between 1742 and 1768, were published in 1821. Several earlier letters of hers written to the Countess of Suffolk are in the two volumes of Lady Suffolk's Letters, 1824.

Two portraits of Lady Hervey are in the possession of the National Trust at Ickworth. Another, formerly belonging to the Strawberry Hill collection, painted by Allan Ramsay, was lent by Lord Lifford[which?] to the Exhibition of National Portraits at South Kensington in 1867. An engraving from a miniature, also formerly at Strawberry Hill, is in Walpole's Letters.

# Marie Leszczyńska

Marie Leszczyńska died on 24 June 1768 at the age of 65. She enjoyed great popularity among the public, and her death deprived the French monarchy of one of its then greatest propaganda assets. She was buried at the Basilica of St Denis, and her heart was entombed at the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours in Nancy (Lorraine).

# Louis Alexandre, Prince of Lamballe

After a dissipated short life, Louis Alexandre died on 6 May 1768, sixteen months after his marriage, of a venereal disease at the Château de Louveciennes in the arms of his ever dutiful wife. He died without any issue. At his death, his father requested that the Gazette de France post a small note for the deceased prince:



He was buried in the family crypt in 13th-century Saint-Lubin church of the village of Rambouillet near the Château de Rambouillet, his father's favorite residence. In 1783, the duc de Penthièvre sold the domain of Rambouillet to his cousin, King Louis XVI. On November 25 of that year, in a long religious procession, Penthièvre transferred the nine caskets containing the remains of his parents, the comte and the comtesse de Toulouse, his wife, Maria Teresa d'Este, and six of their seven children, from the small medieval village church of Rambouillet, to the chapel of the Collégiale Saint-Étienne in Dreux.

# Thomas Mair (minister)

Mair died of what was termed "paralysis" on 17 February 1768. His Covenant of Duties was published posthumously, a series of nine sermons that he had preached years earlier, none of which had any bearing upon the doctrinal point that caused his split with the Anti-Burghers.

His epitaph on his grave in the churchyard at Orwell, reads:

# William Walton (merchant)

Gaine's New York Gazette and Weekly Mercury of July 18, 1768, announced that there "Died on Monday last (July 11th), at his house in this city the Honorable William Walton, Esquire, in the 63d Year of his age. He was one of his Majesty's Council for this Province, and for many Years an Eminent Merchant of this City. His remains were interred in the Family Vault of this City on the Wednesday following."

In his will, Walton ordered that after his wife's death, his household slaves should receive their freedom papers, and an additional annual stipend of £10 or £14. Slave trading was not considered a dishonorable profession in the mid-18th century; records from the British Admiralty list 670 slave ships bound for New York between 1715 and 1765, and some slaves were smuggled into the colonies, but the Waltons' share of that trade was relatively small.

His wife survived him many years. When the British took possession of the city, she abandoned her station, and took refuge in "the Jersies", according to an obituary notice in the New York Packet of May 15, 1786. She died in New Jersey on May 10, 1786, at 78 years of age.

# Sarah Ryan (Methodist)

Sarah Ryan died in Gildersome on 17 August 1768. She was buried at Leeds Old Church.

# Thomas Secker

Secker died at the age of 74 at 3 August 1768 in Lambeth Palace. Church records of the medieval parish church of St Mary-at-Lambeth have revealed that Secker had his viscera buried in a canister in the churchyard. Secker left a substantial bequest to Ann and Thomas Frost of Nottingham. After Secker died his will was disputed by Thomas Frost and he managed to persuade the court that £11,000 intended by Secker for charity should be redirected to his family.

# Laurence Sterne

Less than a month after Sentimental Journey was published, early in 1768, Sterne's strength failed him, and he died in his lodgings at 41 Old Bond Street on 18 March, at the age of 54. He was buried in the churchyard of St George's, Hanover Square.

It was widely rumoured that Sterne's body was stolen shortly after it was interred and sold to anatomists at Cambridge University. Circumstantially, it was said that his body was recognised by Charles Collignon, who knew him and discreetly reinterred back in St George's, in an unknown plot. A year later a group of Freemasons erected a memorial stone with a rhyming epitaph near to his original burial place. A second stone was erected in 1893, correcting some factual errors on the memorial stone. When the churchyard of St. George's was redeveloped in 1969, amongst 11,500 skulls disinterred, several were identified with drastic cuts from anatomising or a post-mortem examination. One was identified to be of a size that matched a bust of Sterne made by Nollekens.

The skull was held up to be his, albeit with "a certain area of doubt". Along with nearby skeletal bones, these remains were transferred to Coxwold churchyard in 1969 by the Laurence Sterne Trust.

The story of the reinterment of Sterne's skull in Coxwold is alluded to in Malcolm Bradbury's novel To the Hermitage.

# Benjamin Tasker Sr.

On his death in 1768, Benjamin Tasker was buried in St. Anne's Churchyard in Annapolis. His tombstone reads:

# Johann Joachim Winckelmann

In 1768 Winckelmann journeyed north over the Alps, but the Tyrol depressed him and he decided to return to Italy. However, his friend, the sculptor and restorer Bartolomeo Cavaceppi managed to persuade him to travel to Munich and Vienna, where he was received with honor by Maria Theresa. On his way back, he was murdered in Trieste on 8 June 1768, in a hotel bed by a fellow traveller, a man named Francesco Arcangeli, for medals that Maria Theresa had given him. Arcangeli had thought that he was only "un uomo di poco conto" ("a man of little account"). Arcangeli was executed a month later by breaking on the wheel.

Winckelmann was buried in the churchyard of Trieste Cathedral. Domenico Rossetti De Scander [it] and Cesare Pagnini [it] documented the last week of Winckelmann's life; Heinrich Alexander Stoll [de] translated the Italian document, the so-called "Mordakte Winckelmann", into German.
