# Henry Alline

Alline fell mortally ill the last week of January 1784, while preaching at North Hampton, New Hampshire. The Reverend David McClure, a Calvinist minister, and his family took him into their home and provided him with whatever comforts they could extend to a dying man. On February 2, he died of complications arising from tuberculosis. McClure and his Church arranged for Alline's burial in their own church burying ground. The epitaph they had cut into his tombstone reads "He was a burning and shining Light, and was justly esteemed the apostle of Nova Scotia."

# George Baylor

Baylor never completely recovered from his injuries, and following the end of the war in 1783 he journeyed to Barbados to regain his health.  However, he continued to weaken and died there in 1784.

# John Bowman (pioneer)

In 1781, Bowman became the first Sheriff and County-Lieutenant of Lincoln County, Kentucky. He also presided over the first county court held in Kentucky, when he and several others were appointed justice of the peace on January 16, 1781. Benjamin Logan succeeded him as County-Lieutenant in July 1781 and Sheriff in November 1783.

Settling down at Bowman Station founded by he and brother Col. Abraham Bowman, Bowman spent his last years at his home.  He hired local residents to tap the maple trees on his property and sold the sugar for a substantial profit. Falling ill, Bowman died at his home on May 4, 1784. Although said to be opinionated and quick to anger, he was both admired and respected by fellow settlers for his bravery.

Following his death, his brother Abraham served as executor of his estate.  In customary fashion, his widow Elizabeth McClung /Bryan /Bowman received one-third of his property with the remainder going towards the education of his son.  John Bowman, Jr. built a fine brick mansion he called the Mt. Pleasant Estate, which is still standing near Ft. Bowman and his father's old station.

  The kirk ruins and William Burnes's grave


Upon his death bed William said that he feared for the good conduct of one of his family. Upon enquiry he told Robert that he was referring to him, evoking silent tears of remorse. He died from 'physical consumption' and exhaustion on 13 February 1784. William was buried in the abandoned Alloway Kirk which he had helped to preserve, despite dying in the parish of Tarbolton. His present headstone is the third, the previous two having been chipped away by souvenir hunters.

# John Campbell of Stonefield

# Ann Cargill

  Tempest, Miss Brown and Mr. Mattocks in the characters of Miranda and Ferdinand


By 1783, she had a new love. Her lover was in the British East India Company and stationed in Calcutta, so she left England for India. In 1783, she performed operatic parts in Calcutta, to tremendous applause, and her benefit night brought in "the astonishing sum of 12,000 rupees."

She was a passenger on the packet ship Nancy, whose captain, John Haldane, was her lover, when it wrecked and sank off the Isles of Scilly on 4 March 1784. Her body, originally unidentified, was buried on Rosevear then reburied at Old Town Church on St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. The newspaper accounts of her death and how the body had been found "floating in her shift" with an infant at her bosom made her a tragic figure for the English press. In September 2008, British divers claimed to have found the wreck of the Nancy, further out from the Isles of Scilly than was previously thought.

# James Caudy

  A West Virginia state highway historical marker commemorating Caudy's defense from Native American attack at Caudy's Castle. The marker is located along West Virginia Route 127 near Forks of Cacapon.


Following his marriage to the widow of James McCoy by 1761, Caudy intended to acquire McCoy's 369 acres (149 ha; 0.577 sq mi) east of Great North Mountain in Frederick County. Caudy's claim to McCoy's land was disputed by John Capper, who claimed to have purchased McCoy's property before his death. A feud developed between Caudy and Capper; it was resolved by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in November 1762. Lord Fairfax awarded 165 acres (67 ha; 0.258 sq mi) to Caudy and the remainder of the disputed land to Capper.

Caudy never learned to write in English; he signed his last will and testament with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him. Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13.
