# Charles XII of Sweden

While in the trenches close to the perimeter of the fortress on 11 December (30 November Old Style), 1718, Charles was struck in the head by a projectile and killed. The shot struck the left side of his skull and exited from the right. The shock of the impact caused the king to grasp his sword with his right hand, and cover the wound with his left hand, leaving his gloves covered in blood. 

The definitive circumstances around Charles's death remain unclear. Despite multiple investigations of the battlefield, Charles's skull and his clothes, it is not known where and when he was hit, or whether the shot came from the ranks of the enemy or from his own men.  There are several hypotheses as to how Charles died, though none can be given with any certainty. Although there were many people around the king at the time of his death, there were no known witnesses to the actual moment he was struck. A likely explanation has been that Charles was killed by the Dano-Norwegians as he was within easy reach of their guns. There are two possibilities that are usually cited: that he was killed by a musket shot, or that he was killed by grapeshot from the nearby fortress.

More sinister theories claim he was assassinated: One is that the killer was a Swedish compatriot and asserts that enemy guns were not firing at the time Charles was struck. Suspects in this claim range from a nearby soldier tired of the siege and wanting to put an end to the war, to an assassin hired by Charles's own brother-in-law, who profited from the event by subsequently taking the throne himself as Frederick I of Sweden, that person being Frederick's aide-de-camp, André Sicre. Sicre confessed during what was claimed to be a state of delirium brought on by fever but later recanted. It has also been suspected that a plot to kill Charles may have been put in place by a group of wealthy Swedes who would benefit from the blocking of a 17% wealth tax that Charles intended to introduce. In the Varberg Fortress museum there is a display with a lead filled brass button - Swedish - that is claimed by some to be the projectile that killed the king.

Another odd account of Charles' death comes from Finnish writer Carl Nordling, who states that the king's surgeon, Melchior Neumann, dreamed the king had told him that he was not shot from the fortress but from "one who came creeping".



  From the autopsy of Charles XII in 1917

Charles's body has been exhumed on three occasions to ascertain the cause of death; in 1746, 1859 and 1917. The 1859 exhumation found that the wound was in accordance with a shot from the Norwegian fort. In 1917, his head was photographed. Peter Englund asserted in his essay "On the death of Charles XII and other murders" that the mortal wound sustained by the King, with a smaller exit wound than entry wound, would be consistent with being hit by a bullet with a speed not exceeding 150 m/s, concluding that Charles was killed by stray grapeshot from the nearby fortress.  

Charles was succeeded to the Swedish throne by his sister, Ulrika Eleonora. As his duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken required a male heir, Charles was succeeded as ruler there by his cousin Gustav Leopold. Georg Heinrich von Görtz, Charles' minister, was beheaded in 1719.

# Martin Chartier

Martin Chartier died in April, 1718, on his farm in Dekanoagah, Pennsylvania. His funeral was attended by James Logan, the future Mayor of Philadelphia. Logan said of Martin that "he was a very decent man, but too generous to grow rich." Immediately after the funeral, Logan seized Martin Chartier's 250-acre estate on the grounds that Martin owed him a debt of 108 pounds, 19 shillings and 3 and 3/4 pence. He later sold the property to Stephen Atkinson for 30 pounds.

In 1873, Chartier's grave was accidentally discovered by the then owner of the property, John Stehman. Chartier was evidently buried in traditional Shawnee style, but with his helmet, a cutlass, and several small cannon balls. A historical marker, erected in 1925, stands on the site of his burial, in Washington Boro, Pennsylvania, at the intersection of River Road and Charlestown Road.

# Suk-bin Choe

In 1718, the Royal Noble Consort Choi Suk-bin died at the age of 49 in Inhyeon Palace. That same year, Sukjong declared the Crown Prince Gyeongjong as regent, who ruled in his stead.

In her memorial tablet (which is in Soryeongwon, her royal tomb), under the description of her character it is written: 



"Her disposition and her status was absolutely indivisible. She did not scruple on people. She was respectful and always waited on Queen Inhyeon and later on Queen Inwon. Her wisdom and intelligence shined on her interaction with others. She kept to her duty and protocol. She never entered in palace disputes. She spent her days in peace and harmony." She is buried in Soryeongwon (昭寧園) in Paju, designated as historical site no. 358 (address: 267 Yeongjang-ri, Gwangtan-myeon, Paju, Gyeonggi Province).


Sukjong died in 1720, supposedly after telling Yi Yi-myoung to name Prince Yeoning as Gyeongjong's heir.

When her son became king, Yeongjo set up a Jesil to grieve over her death near her grave as a display of his deep filial piety. in addition to building tablet houses on the four spots around her grave, he also erected gravestones, the contents of which were written by him in her memory. Her memorial tablet was enshrined in the Sukbinmyo, later called Yuksangmyo ("shrine"), and Chilgung (historical site no. 149), the place which houses the ancestral tablets of seven royal concubines, all of whom were birth mothers of Kings that never achieved the status of a Queen.

Choi was given the posthumous title "Lady Hwagyeong, Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Choe clan" (Korean: 화경숙빈최씨; Hanja: 和瓊淑嬪崔氏). She was raised to the posthumous titles of Hwa-gyong ("harmonious reverence") in 1753, and was again elevated to Hwi-deok ("magnificent virtue") and An-sun ("tranquil purity").

# Elizabeth Capell, Countess of Essex

She died on 5 February 1718, and was buried in Watford, Hertfordshire.

# William Johnson (English politician)

Johnson  was reported to have died at Cape Coast Castle in November 1718. He and his wife had three sons and nine daughters.  All his property was to be sold, and the proceeds divided equally among the surviving members of his family, except for his one married daughter.

# Bhai Kanhaiya

Bhai Kanhaiya died in 1718 CE after retiring to Sodhara. His example, as a forerunner of the present day Red Cross, is a tribute to the universal message of compassion and kindness to all.

While the world hails Henry Dunant, founder of the Red Cross, as the first humanitarian at the service for the care of war victims, Sikhism produced Bhai Kanhaiya, more than 100 years before the inception of the Red Cross.

Today Bhai Kanhaiaya Ji may not be with us physically, but as you walk in the compound of the memorial asthaan,  Gurudwara Aduti Sewa, you can almost sense his presence amidst the surroundings. Suddenly an image of this tall, lean figure, carrying a mushak full of water behind his back begins to flash in front of your eyes; especially when you walk towards his old hut (Kutiaa), which has been restored to its original form.
