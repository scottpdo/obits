# Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby

On 17 November 1795, he died of pulmonary disease at Exmouth.

# Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria

  Empress Maria Theresa


Archduke Alexander Leopold, suffering from poor health, left Hungary for Vienna in 1795, after dealing with the conspiracy. His memorandum, written during his stay in Vienna, shows a rather conservative worldview. He argued that differences between classes should not be overcome, especially when it comes to education.

Because of his interest in chemistry and especially in pyrotechnics, Archduke Alexander Leopold decided to prepare a firework display at Laxenburg Palace in order to surprise his sister-in-law and cousin, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. He decided to manufacture and light the fireworks himself in the casemates of the palace, attended by a few of his servants. Empress Maria Theresa was on her way to spend summer at the palace and when her arrival was announced by a gunshot, Alexander Leopold lit the first rocket. At that moment, the door opened and a draught of air threw the rocket back on the gunpowder. The gunpowder exploded and, unable to escape, Alexander Leopold was burned all over his body. He died immediately, as did his servants.

His body is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. His heart was buried separately in Herzgruft, Augustinian Church, Vienna. His younger brother, Archduke Joseph, succeeded him as palatine of Hungary.

# Josiah Bartlett

He retired to his home in Kingston and died there on May 19, 1795. The cause of death was paralysis. He is buried next to his wife Mary in the Plains Cemetery, also at Kingston. Relatives of Bartlett still live in his home and give tours throughout the year. A bronze statue of Bartlett stands in the town square of Amesbury, Massachusetts. His portrait hangs in the State House in Concord, New Hampshire, drawn from an original by John Trumbull. Bartlett, New Hampshire, a town just north of Conway, is named in his honor, and the Josiah Bartlett Elementary School is a visible presence on its major roadway. The Bartlett School operated from 1870 until it was closed in 1968, is currently operating as the Bartlett Museum, Inc.. Bartlett's 1774 house, which still stands, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. The gastropub, J. Bartlett's Public House, located inside of the Whole Foods Market grocery store in Nashua is also named after him.

# David Blackburn (Royal Navy officer)

He died of illness on 10 January 1795 at Haslar Naval Hospital, Gosport, Hampshire, England.

# Samuel Brady

Much of Samuel's zeal for fighting and, indeed killing, Indians doubtlessly originated in the deaths at their hands of his brother, James Brady on August 8, 1778 and his father, Captain John Brady in close succession on April 11, 1779. As the story goes, James Brady had a full head of handsome red hair, which, as was the custom of the day, he wore long and tied up at the back. James Brady and others, had his hair "done up" by a Mrs. Buckalow. "He was lively and full of nonsense, and she said to him, 'Ah, Jim, I fear the Indians will get this red scalp of yours yet.' 'If they do', he replied, 'it will make a bright light on a dark night'.  In less than a week he fell a prey to the tomahawk, and the savages held his scalp as a trophy."

The Indians killed the family of a Peter Smith on June 10, 1778.  His farm was on the banks of Bull Run, close to present day Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Men were sent from Fort Muncy to help him bring in his crop. A corporal and a party of three militia men were also sent from Fort Muncy to protect them all. James Brady was in this party of soldiers and was, as the bravest among them, selected their "captain", as was the custom when no commissioned officer was present. Four of their party returned to Fort Muncy that night. In the morning, the Indians attacked the remaining party under the cover of the morning fog.




A panic seemed to seize the party and they all fled, with the exception of young Brady, who ran for his rifle, pursued by three Indians. When he was within a few feet of it he was fired at, but falling over a sheaf of grain the shot missed him. He immediately arose, and as he was in the act of grasping his rifle, he was wounded by a shot in the arm from an Indian. He succeeded in getting a hold of his gun and shot the first Indian dead. Then he caught up another gun and brought down a second savage, when the party closed around him. Being stout, active and brave, he fought them vigorously for a few minutes. Finally he was struck in the head with a tomahawk and almost immediately afterwards received a thrust from a spear, which so stunned him that he fell. He had no sooner fallen than he was pounced upon and his scalp ruthlessly torn from his head. It was considered a great trophy by the Indians, as he had very long and remarkably red hair. A little Indian was then called and made to strike a tomahawk into his head in four places. The Indians then hurriedly fled.— 



Miraculously, young James survived this attack.  He made it to a cabin where their aged cook, Jerome Vanness was hiding. Vanness dressed James' wounds as best he could, refusing James's request that he flee for his own life. He returned James' rifle and, at James request, took him to the river bank.  A relief force arrived from Fort Muncy the next morning. James, believing them to be Indians returning, jumped up with his rifle, ready to battle them. They took him to the home of his mother, Mary Quigley Brady in Sunbury, Pennsylvania by boat.  She rushed to the river to meet them. The grief of this hardened frontier woman was reported to have been "pitable to behold." James Brady only lasted five days after his arrival at his mother's home. He finally succumbed to his wounds on August 13, 1778. Samuel Brady rushed home, but arrived after his brother's death.  However, he swore he would avenge his brother's death. Unfortunately, the location of James' grave, supposed to have been near Fort Augusta, Pennsylvania, has been long forgotten. Belle Swope says, "He was deeply mourned for he was a great favorite with all who knew him."

# Alessandro Cagliostro

Cagliostro left England to visit Rome, where he met two people who proved to be spies of the Inquisition. Some accounts hold that his wife was the one who initially betrayed him to the Inquisition. On 27 December 1789 he was arrested and imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo. He was tried and originally sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment at the Forte di San Leo, where he would die on 26 August 1795.

# Louis Grégoire Deschamps Destournelles

On 12 Germinal year II (1 April 1794) Lazare Carnot proposed to suppress the executive council and the six ministers, replacing the ministers with twelve Committees reporting to the Committee of Public Safety. The proposal was unanimously adopted by the National Convention.
During the Terror (5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794) Destournelles tried in vain to defend one of his brothers, but was arrested himself. He was kept in prison until 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794). Convinced that he would not escape execution by the revolutionaries, he took poison during his captivity. 
The dose did not kill him immediately, but hastened his death.
Destournelles died in Passy, today the 17th arrondissement of Paris, on 27 July 1795.

# Marianne Ehrmann

On 14 August 1795 Marianne Ehrmann Brentano died in Stuttgart at the age of 39 years of pneumonia. Her posthumous writings Amaliens Feierstunden (literally: Amalie's celebration hours) were published in 1796. Marianne Ehrmann's visionary dream of an individual female independence and her hope to establish an outliving progressive female publication were not realized within the next hundred years, but she was regarded by contemporary people as a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment.

# Robert Faulknor the younger

  Mort au combat du capitaine Robert Faulknor le jeune le 5 janvier 1795 lors de l'engagement de la Frégate la Blanche contre la frégate la Pique - Guadeloupe


Blanche was detached in December 1794 to cruise off the island of Desirade. That island was held by the French and on 4 January 1795, Blanche's crew discovered the French frigate Pique off Pointe à Pitre, Guadeloupe. The French ship at first seemed to be trying to avoid an action, but the two ships eventually came to close quarters in the early hours of 5 January, in an engagement of over 3¾ hours in which Blanche lost her main and mizzen masts. One and a quarter hours in, Pique ran her bow on board Blanche, making her unable to bring any of her guns to bear on Blanche and (once the English crew had rapidly lashed the French ship's bowsprit to the remains of Blanche's main mast) unable to manoeuvre. Faulknor was wounded, but not fatally, and continued to direct the action until two musket shots killed him. Lieutenant Frederick Watkins took over command. Two hours later Pique surrendered. Faulknor was buried the day after his death on the Isles des Saintes and following news of his death, he was commemorated with a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, London.

# Jean-Bertrand Féraud

  Boissy d'Anglas saluting the head of Féraud, by Charles Fournier, (Musée de la Révolution française)


In the winter and spring of Year III (1795), agriculture and trade were in chaos and the currency was rapidly devaluing.  Townspeople were starving as the prices of staple foods rose. The Convention, which had mobilised its armies against external threats and deployed them to repress rebellions in the provinces, could hardly contain the unrest in Paris. During the Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III the crowds forced their way into the Convention's sessions to demand bread.

Newly placed in charge of supplies for Paris, Féraud tried to harangue the crowd while waiting for reinforcements from the National Guard, but a woman in the crowd, incensed, shot him dead with a pistol. The crowd cut off his head, hoisted it on a pike, and then carried it aloft into the chamber of the Convention in front of its President - who was not Boissy d'Anglas as shown in a famous painting by Fragonard, but Theodore Vernier. This was the first and only time that a legislator was killed by the Paris mob.

In the tumult, a 50-year-old locksmith's assistant named Jean Tinelle was arrested and condemned to death on 5 Prairial Year III for having carried the head on the pike. He was the 2,807th and final person to be condemned to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal before it was suppressed.

There are various extant representations of Féraud's death, including engravings, paintings and sketches, as well as numerous accounts in newspapers and letters.

# James Finley (minister)

James Finley died on January 6, 1795 in Rostraver, Pennsylvania and is buried at Rehoboth Presbyterian Churchyard.

# William Fleming (governor)

Fleming's health visibly declined by 1792, and he was unable to visit his Warfield grandchildren in Kentucky, but he still managed to visit New London in September, as well as arrange for the marriage of his daughter Eliza to Cary Allen in 1794. Col. William Fleming died at his home on August 5, 1795, and was buried in the family graveyard in what decades later became Hollins, Virginia. His widow would rest beside him in 1810, and become the namesake of the Nancy Christian Fleming Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Their daughter Annie would marry a prominent Presbyterian clergyman, Rev. George Baxter, who presided over Washington College (under the supervision of this Fleming and other trustees), although only his widow ultimately survive the American Civil War in Lexington, Virginia, not very far from where her parents had courted. Their son Leonard Israel Fleming would marry Nancy Marshal Bacey and live in Kentucky. The Library of Virginia has this William Fleming's papers as governor and executive officer, as well as those of the judge William Fleming with whom he is often confused.

William Fleming High School in Roanoke, Virginia, is named for him. Their mascot is "The Colonel." The first planned community in Roanoke was named "Belmont" to honor his one-time plantation, albeit indirectly through the Belmont Land Company (1888), and is now being considered for nomination as a historic district.

# Ibrahim El-Gohary

Ibrahim El-Gohary died four years later, on Monday, 25 Pashons, 1511 A.M. (31 May 1795) His eulogy was made by Pope John XVIII, and his funeral was attended by Ibrahim Bey. He was buried in a private tomb that he had built for himself next to the church of Saint George in Old Cairo.

# Robert Jacob Gordon

As commander of the garrison, Gordon was responsible for the Cape's defense. In 1794-1795, the French successfully invaded the Netherlands. As a result, the Prince of Orange, as Stadtholder, the de facto head of state of the Dutch Republic, fled to England. In 1795, a British fleet arrived at the Cape claiming that they had instructions to occupy the colony in the Prince of Orange's name. Gordon initially complied, but was later accused of treason by his own soldiers for allowing the British occupation. Gordon had become an outcast and a target of derision and violence. On 25 October 1795 he committed suicide at his house Schoonder Sight.

# Francis Gregg

Gregg died in Bedford Square on 22 February 1826, at age 67.

# Herman Husband

At about age 71, he died in June 1795 in a tavern outside Philadelphia, allegedly from an illness contracted in prison.  His burial location is unknown.

# William Jackson (journalist)

Jackson remained in prison for a year before his trial took place.  The delays were at his request, allowing him time to assemble a defence and procure witnesses.  During his imprisonment, he wrote his last work, Observations in Answer to Mr. Paine’s Age of Reason (1795), which took issue with Thomas Paine's Deism.  The work is notable for the way Jackson promotes Anglican orthodoxy while also praising Paine for his politics and betraying no remorse for his own treason.  His trial took place on 23 April 1795, in Dublin  and he was found guilty. One week later, on the morning of his sentencing hearing Jackson stepped into the dock looking terribly ill. He reportedly vomited out of the carriage window on his ride from prison to the courtroom, and when he removed his hat, one observer noted that steam rose from his head.  As his lawyers made drawn out speeches, hoping to avoid judgment on the technicality of an improperly filed indictment, Jackson's condition steadily worsened. He gripped his sides, shuddering and grimacing in pain.  The judges ordered that a chair be provided for him and asked that a doctor attend him.  He then collapsed and died.  An autopsy found that Jackson had ingested a large quantity of a "metallic poison."  This was likely administered by his (then pregnant) second wife, but the inquest pointedly refused to assign blame. The effect of his suicide was that he had not actually been pronounced guilty of treason by the court, and so his family could inherit his goods and a pension. No such clemency was shown to Lord Edward Fitzgerald, who died of his wounds before trial but was found posthumously guilty of high treason. Jackson was survived by his wife, one son, and one daughter.

# John Johnstone (East India Company)

  Alva House in the early 20th century


Johnstone died on 10 December 1795, aged 61, at home in Alva House,
which had been remodelled and expanded in 1789 to the designs of Robert Adam.
The works included a mausoleum to house the remains of Johnstone and his wife Caroline.

His son James Raymond Johnstone (died 1830), had 8 children, of whom the eldest James Johnstone (1801–1888) was MP for Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire.

Alva house remained in his family for over a century, and in 1890 it passed to his descendant Carolin Johnstone. She sold the surrounding estate to reduce her debts, but failed to clear them, and the house was abandoned by the 1920s. It was used for target practice during World War II, and left in ruins.

# Thomas Linley the elder

Linley died suddenly on 19 November 1795 at his home, 11 Southampton Street in Westminster. He was survived by his wife, but most of his children had predeceased him at a young age.

# Francis Marion

Marion returned to his plantation to find it had been burnt during the fighting. His slaves had run away to fight for the British and had later been evacuated from Charleston. He borrowed money to purchase slaves for his plantation.

After the war, Marion married his cousin, Mary Esther Videau.

Marion served several terms in the South Carolina State Senate. In 1784, in recognition of his services, he was made commander of Fort Johnson, South Carolina, a virtual sinecure position, with a salary of $500 per annum. He died on his estate in 1795, at the age of 63, and was buried at Belle Isle Plantation Cemetery in Berkeley County, South Carolina.

# Samuel McTier

Mebane, North Carolina is named for him.

# Mulla Muhammad Mahdi Naraqi

He died on 1795 (23 Muharram 1209 AH) and was buried near Ali ibn Abi Talib shrine in Najaf.

# Grand Duchess Olga Pavlovna of Russia

The almost-three-year-old Grand Duchess died on 26 January [O.S. 15] 1795. A letter to Catherine the Great stated:




The 13th Grand Duchess, Olga, died. And imagine why? For eighteen weeks, she revealed a hunger and she constantly asked to eat, because she grew too great for her two and a half years, at that time many molars came at once, and after sixteen weeks of suffering and a slow debilitating fever occurred daily, she died between seven and eight o'clock in the evening ...



  The family of Tsar Paul I, by Gerhard von Kügelgen, 1800.


The same year, Gavrila Derzhavin dedicated a poem to her death, entitled "On the death of Grand Duchess Olga Pavlovna", just as he had dedicated a poem to her when she was born. Out of the ten children born to Paul and Sophia, Olga was the only one that died during her childhood years. The funeral was held at the Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, Olga's burial place. The Empress herself was at the funeral, dressed in a white dress, with gray hair disheveled, pale and silent. In 1800, when Olga would have been eight, Gerhard von Kügelgen painted a portrait of Paul I's family. Behind the family, a bust of Olga stood high in front of a forest.

# William Parsons (actor)

On 21 September 1762, Parsons married Mary Price, who was in the play The Beggar's Opera with him. After Parsons's first wife died in 1787, he remarried Dorothy or Dorthea. Parsons had one child, a son named Stewart.

On 3 February 1795, Parsons died, partially due to his asthma at his home in Mead's Row Lambeth. His tomb in Lee, Kent currently has a rhymed epitaph over it.

Parsons left his leasehold estate Stangate and his small Bearsted freehold to his son Stewart. Parsons left 591 per annum and leasehold houses in London Road and his leasehold estate in Mead's to his wife.

# Peter Bower

# William Smellie (encyclopedist)

  William Smellie's grave, Greyfriars Kirkyard


At the time of his hiring, Smellie edited a weekly called the Scots Journal, which made him familiar with the editing and publication of a work in parts.  He went on to print and edit the Edinburgh Weekly Journal as joint owner with William Auld, and was co-owner, editor, and contributor to the Edinburgh Magazine and Review. He printed and edited Domestic Medicine: or, a Treatise on the Prevention and Cure of Diseases by Regimen and Simple Medicines by William Buchan in 1769. He also edited the first transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, which were published in 1792. 

Smellie is also noted for his English translation of the famous Histoire Naturelle of the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. 

In 1779, Smellie was nominated to be the University of Edinburgh's professor of natural history; however,  the post was awarded to Dr. John Walker, allegedly due to politics.

In 1781 Smellie was made keeper and superintendent of the Edinburgh Museum of Natural History.

From 1782 he had William Creech as his business partner.

Smellie continued to publish a wide variety of works, including his two-volume Philosophy of Natural History, which became a set text at Harvard University in the 19th century, and at least two of the four-volume set of Thesaurus medicus: sive, disputationum, in Academia Edinensi, ad rem medicam pertinentium, a collegio instituto ad hoc usque tempus, delectu which reprinted Edinburgh medical theses of the 18th century.

In his Philosophy of Natural History he described the struggle for existence. He has been described as a "precursor of Darwin".

His printing office stood at the foot of Anchor Close off the Royal Mile (on a site now on East Market Street) and his house was on Gosford's Close nearby. Gosford's Close was pulled down when the city built George IV Bridge in 1830.

He died in Edinburgh on 24 June 1795 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard just north of the Adam Mausoleum, south-west of the church.

He was well-acquainted with Robert Burns. Burns' assessment is engraved on Smellie's tombstone: "Here lies a man who did honour to human nature". Burns also described him fondly in a letter as "that old Veteran in Genius, Wit and Bawdry".

Papers from Smellie's archive, including his correspondence and manuscripts, are held by the Library of the National Museum of Scotland.

# Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah

He died from gangrene poisoning, at Madras on 13 October 1795. He was buried  outside the gate of the Gunbad of Shah Chand Mastan, Trichinopoly.

He was succeeded by his son Umdat ul-Umara, who was later accused of supporting Tipu Sultan the heir of Hyder Ali during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War.
