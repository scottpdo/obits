# John Cabess

Cabess died in June 1722 in Komenda.  The British and Dutch feared a large succession struggle by the many heirs of Cabess. The RAC administrators dispatched an officer to provide gifts to those members most likely to take the place of Cabess.  His body was buried at the British fort in Komenda after a public viewing of his body.  His son Ahenaqua took over much of the trade and political power of Cabess, without a recorded succession struggle, and until the chiefs at Cape Coast became predominant over Komenda in the mid-1700s, the main official at Komenda, the Caboceer, governed on what was known as "the stool of the late John Cabess."

# Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine

Elisabeth Charlotte died at age 70 on 8 December 1722, at the Château de Saint-Cloud, near Paris. She and her husband, the Duke of Orléans, were the founders of the modern House of Orléans. Their only surviving son, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, was the Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV of France. She became the ancestress of Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, and France's Citizen-King Louis Philippe.[citation needed] Through her daughter, the Duchess of Lorraine, she was the paternal great-grandmother of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France.

# Thomas Gordon (lawyer)

He died in 1722 and is buried in St. Peter's Churchyard, Perth Amboy, NJ. https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6837167  The church property was deeded by Thomas B. Gordon to the parish.  "A new and beautiful House of God had been erected which stood from 1721 until 1850 or for a period of nearly one hundred and thirty years. It was the second place of worship for the churchmen of Perth Amboy, but the first to occupy the present church site taking the place of the converted Court House given by the Colonial Proprietors and situated on the Long Ferry property-now known as Caledonian Park. The parish had become incorporated just four years earlier receiving its charter from King George I. The old corner stone bearing the date 1685, the oldest historic relic of Perth Amboy now built into the chancel wall of the church, was originally probably the stone in the stone grist mill of David Mudie which was on the same site with the present church. David Mudie was the father in-law of Thomas Gordon and Thomas Gordon, inheriting this property through his wife, afterward deeded it to the church for a church building and for a burying ground."

# Kangxi Emperor

Following the deposition of the crown prince, the Kangxi Emperor implemented groundbreaking changes in the political landscape. The 13th prince, Yinxiang, was placed under house arrest as well for cooperating with Yinreng. The eighth prince Yinsi was stripped of all his titles and only had them restored years later. The 14th prince Yinti, whom many considered to be the most likely candidate to succeed the Kangxi Emperor, was sent on a military campaign during the political conflict. Yinsi, along with the ninth and tenth princes, Yintang and Yin'e, pledged their support to Yinti.

In the evening of 20 December 1722 before his death, the Kangxi Emperor called seven of his sons to assemble at his bedside. They were the third, fourth, eighth, ninth, tenth, 16th and 17th princes. After the Kangxi Emperor died, Longkodo announced that the emperor had selected the fourth prince, Yinzhen, as the new emperor. Yinzhen ascended to the throne and became known as the Yongzheng Emperor. The Kangxi Emperor was entombed at the Eastern Tombs in Zunhua, Hebei.

A legend concerning the Kangxi Emperor's will states that he chose Yinti as his heir, but Yinzhen forged the will in his own favour. It has, however, long been refuted by serious historians. Yinzhen, later the Yongzheng Emperor, has attracted many rumours, and some novel-like private books claim he did not die of illness but was assassinated by a swordswoman, Lü Siniang (吕四娘), the granddaughter of Lü Liuliang, though this is never treated seriously by scholars.

# William Lewen

Lewen died without issue on 16 March 1722, shortly after Parliament was dissolved and was buried at St Mary Ewell. His heir was his nephew George Lewen. His wife Susannah died in 1737.
