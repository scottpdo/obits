# Alamgir II

The newly appointed Mughal Grand Vizier after Ahmad Shah Durrani's invasion was Najib-ud-Daula who tried to consolidate the remains of the Mughal Empire by uniting distant Faujdars, Nawab's and Nizams into a common cause against the Marathas. Fearing their wrath the deposed Imad-ul-Mulk aligned himself with the Maratha leader Sadashivrao Bhau and launched an counterattack agianst Najib-ud-Daula which lasted 15 days and resulted in the defeat of Najib-ud-Daula who was drriven North. 

Imad-ul-Mulk then feared that the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II would recall Ahmad Shah Durrani, or use his son Prince Ali Gauhar, to dispossess him of his newfound power with the Marathas. Therefore, Imad-ul-Mulk plotted to murder the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and his family. A few Mughal Princes, including Ali Gauhar desperately managed to escape before assassination. In November 1759, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II was told that a pious man had come to meet him, Alamgir II, ever so eager to meet holy men, set out immediately to meet him at Kotla Fateh Shah, he was stabbed repeatedly by Imad-ul-Mulk's assassins. The Mughal Emperor Alamgir II's death was mourned throughout the Mughal Empire, particularly by the Muslim populace.

After the assassination of Alamgir II in 1759, the Peshwa under the sway of Sadashivrao Bhau had reached the peak of its short-lived power particularly when their involvement in the assassination had become eminent when he discussed abolishing the Mughal Empire and placing Vishwasrao on the throne in Delhi by bribing or deposing Imad-ul-Mulk.

# Eugene Aram

He was found guilty, and condemned to be executed on 6 August 1759, three days after his trial. While in his cell he confessed his guilt, and threw new light on the motives for his crime, by asserting that he had discovered an affair between Clark and his own wife. On the night before his execution he made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide by opening the veins in his arm with a razor.

Eugene Aram was hanged at York's Tyburn in an area of the Knavesmire on 16 August 1759. His skull is preserved in King's Lynn museum.

# Thomas Bradbury

Bradbury died on Sunday, 9 September 1759, and was buried atn Bunhill Fields burial ground. His wife's name was Richmond. He left two daughters, one married (1744) to John Winter, brother to Richard Winter, who succeeded Bradbury, and father to Robert Winter, D.D., who succeeded Richard; the other daughter married (1768) George Welch, a banker. Besides the publications noticed above, Bradbury printed several funeral and other sermons, including two on the death of Robert Bragge (died 1738; "eternal Bragge" of Lime Street, who preached for four months on Joseph's coat).

# Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville

Upon his return, Céloron was reappointed to the important post at Detroit, and in 1753, was promoted to Major and appointed to Montreal. He died at Montreal on April 14, 1759 (Burton, 332).

# Peter Chartier

Peter Chartier was last seen in 1758 in a village on the Wabash River, however he is mentioned later in a 1760 letter from Governor-General Vaudreuil-Cavagnial:

There is evidence that Chartier (as well as his mother Sewatha Straight Tail) died in an outbreak of smallpox that had originated in 1757 in Quebec and later spread to Native American communities across North America.

# Henry Darnall II

Henry Darnall II died in 1759, aged around 77. A small portion of Darnall's former property, now called Darnall's Chance, can still be visited today. No portrait of him survives.

# Ferdinand VI of Spain

The death of his wife Barbara, who had been devoted to him, and who carefully abstained from political intrigue, broke his heart. Between the date of her death in August 1758 and his own on 10 August 1759, he fell into a state of prostration in which he would not even dress, but wandered unshaven, unwashed and in a nightgown about his park. The memoirs of the count of Fernán Núñez give a shocking picture of his deathbed. As the couple had no children, Ferdinand VI of Spain was succeeded as King by his half-brother Charles III.

# Christopher Gist

It is said, that, during the summer of 1759, he contracted smallpox and died in Virginia, South Carolina, or Georgia. Other reports have him surviving until 1794 and dying in Cumberland, North Carolina (although this narrative may confuse Christopher son of Richard Gist with a cousin also named Christopher Gist, one of Richard's grandsons through Nathaniel Gist and Mary Howard).

# Giovanni Antonio Guadagni

He died in Rome in 1759 and was buried at the left side of the main altar in Santa Maria della Scala in the tomb that he had constructed for himself. He also composed the inscription that was placed on the tomb. He became reputed for his holiness and was said to have been buried with the odor of saintliness.

# Zachary Hamlyn

Zachary Hamlyn died on 22 June 1759, aged 82. As requested in his will, he was buried in the chancel of the parish church of Wolfardisworthy, but his mural monument is in Clovelly Church. A fine painting of him by Joseph Highmore (1692–1780) was destroyed in the fire at Clovelly Court in 1789, but an engraving of it (but possibly of his friend the author Samuel Richardson) by James MacArdell (c.1729–1765) exists in the National Portrait Gallery. A relief sculpted portrait bust exists on his mural monument in Clovelly Church. (See full text on Wikisource of s:Last Will and Testament of Zachary Hamlyn).

# George Frideric Handel

Handel's father died on 11 February 1697. It was German custom for friends and family to compose funeral odes for a substantial burgher like Georg, and young Handel discharged his duty with a poem dated 18 February and signed with his name and (in deference to his father's wishes) "dedicated to the liberal arts." At the time Handel was studying either at Halle's Lutheran Gymnasium or the Latin School.

Mainwaring has Handel traveling to Berlin the next year, 1698. The problem with Mainwaring as an authority for this date, however, is that he tells of how Handel's father communicated with the "king"[m] during Handel's stay, declining the Court's offer to send Handel to Italy on a stipend and that his father died "after his return from Berlin." But since Georg Händel died in 1697, either the date of the trip or Mainwaring's statements about Handel's father must be in error. Early biographers solved the problem by making the year of the trip 1696, then noting that at the age of 11 Handel would need a guardian, so they have Handel's father or a friend of the family accompany him, all the while puzzling over why the elder Handel, who wanted Handel to become a lawyer, would spend the sum to lead his son further into the temptation of music as a career. Schoelcher for example has Handel traveling to Berlin at 11, meeting both Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti in Berlin and then returning at the direction of his father. But Ariosti was not in Berlin before the death of Handel's father, and Handel could not have met Bononcini in Berlin before 1702. Modern biographers either accept the year as 1698, since most reliable older authorities agree with it,[n] and discount what Mainwaring says about what took place during the trip or assume that Mainwaring conflated two or more visits to Berlin, as he did with Handel's later trips to Venice.

# James Innes (North Carolina)

Innes lived out the remainder of his life as a planter at "Point Pleasant", his plantation in North Carolina.  Innes left behind his wife Jean, with whom he had no children, and who later married his business associate, Francis Corbin. After her death, Jean Innes was buried between her two husbands.

# Gurbaksh Singh Kanhaiya

The Kanhaiyas, who had replaced the Bhangis as the most powerful misl, disputed Ranjit Singh's father's right to plunder Jammu, and in one of the many skirmishes between the two misls, Gurbaksh Singh was killed in battle against Maha singh in February 1785.

In the absence of any heir, Gurbaksh Singh's widowed wife, Sada Kaur (an intelligent and ambitious woman) became the chief of the Kanhaiya Misl after her father-in-law's death in 1789. She played an important role in Ranjit Singh's rise to power in Punjab and used to lend support of the Kanhaiya misl to Ranjit Singh till 1821, when she developed differences with him and as a consequence lost her territory to him.

# Benjamin Lay

Benjamin Lay died in Abington, Pennsylvania, in 1759. His legacy continued to inspire the abolitionist movement for generations; throughout the early and mid-19th century, it was common for abolitionist Quakers to keep pictures of Lay in their homes. Benjamin Lay was buried in Abington Friends Meeting's burial ground in a grave whose exact location is unknown, but next to the meeting house and adjacent to Abington Friends School in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. In 2012, during the brief Occupy Jenkintown encampment, protesters symbolically rechristened the Jenkintown Town Square as "Benjamin Lay Plaza".

In 2018, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission erected an historical marker in Abington commemorating Lay. On April 21, 2018, Abington Friends Meeting unveiled a grave marker for Benjamin and Sarah Lay in its graveyard.

Four Quaker meetings had disowned Lay for his inconvenient campaigning. In 2018, Southern East Anglia Area Meeting, part of Britain Yearly Meeting, became the last of the four to "undisown" him. The others were Abington Monthly Meeting and Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in the USA and North London Area Meeting in Britain.

# Johann von Mayr

n the spring of 1758 he made a successful advance, burning the imperial magazine and plundering an armory in Suhl, in which he captured 2200 guns. His expedition to Plauen in the middle of February 1758, the capture of Hof on 12 April, and the capture of Bamberg on 31 May, by fewer than 2000 men, generated fear, despondency and horror. During the summer and autumn 1758, Mayr was entrusted with several particularly dangerous assignments in Saxony. When General Georg Wilhelm von Driesen was commanded to return to Franconia on another occasion, Mayr led his avant-garde, remained in summer and autumn in Saxony, and was often entrusted with special commissions, especially when defending Dresden. In November, he distinguished himself with special bravery in the defense of Dresden against Count Leopold Joseph von Daun and was promoted to Generalmajor. After Daun had lifted his camp before Dresden on 16 November 1758, and had retreated, Mayr followed him as far the Bohemian frontier. At the beginning of December 1758, he moved his corps into the winter quarters at Plauen. He died in January 1759 in Plauen of a pneumonia and, although a Catholic and Jesuit-educated, was buried with military honors in front of the altar of the cemetery church of Plauen.

The later general inspector of the American continental army  Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben served as his adjutant of Mayr,  Prussian Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm René de l’Homme de Courbière was a young captain in the Freibataillon.

Among the many eulogies written for him, this one written by the bibliophile Praetorius (a nom de plume) strikingly frames the fear he struck into the towns he raided:

# Charles Montagu (of Papplewick)

Montagu died on 29 May 1759. He had two sons and a daughter.  His widow became well known in society and was an intimate friend of Mary, dowager-countess of Gower (the widow of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower), and of Mary Delany, in whose published 'Correspondence' she frequently figures as 'my Mrs Montague', in order to distinguish her from the better known Elizabeth Montagu. Her London residence was in Hanover Square and she died on 31 May 1780. Their son Frederick succeeded to Papplewick and built Papplewick Hall in around 1787.

# Louis-Joseph de Montcalm

While riding back towards the city, General Montcalm was hit in the back by musket shot. Assisted by three soldiers, he regained the city where he was taken before a surgeon, who announced Montcalm would not live through the night. During the afternoon, the general drew on his last reserves of strength and signed his last official act as commander of the French army in Canada. In a letter addressed to General Wolfe, who unbeknownst to him had also fallen in battle, Montcalm attempted to surrender the city, despite the fact he did not hold the authority to do so. He died around 5:00 am on 14 September 1759. At 8:00 am, he was buried in a shell hole under the choir of the Ursuline church.

# Louise Henriette de Bourbon

Louise Henriette died on 9 February 1759 at age 32, with her husband and children at her side, at the Palais-Royal, the Orléans residence in Paris. Her son and daughter were, respectively, eleven and eight years old. After her death, her husband had several mistresses, ultimately finding the love of his life, the witty but married marquise de Montesson, whom he married after she became a widow. Like her mother, who had inherited the title through her Condé's ancestry, Louise Henriette was the duchesse d'Étampes in her own right, having inherited the title on the occasion of her husband's rise to the head of the House of Orléans in 1752. At her death, her son inherited the ducal title, which he held until it became extinct in 1792, during the French Revolution. 

In June 1759, shortly after his twelfth birthday, Louis Philippe, her only son, was presented before the court at Versailles, officially meeting King Louis XV and the royal family. Despite their detached relationship, the Duke of Orléans was greatly affected by his wife's death, and so was their son. Louise Henriette was buried at the Val-de-Grâce in Paris.[citation needed]

# Marie Louise Trichet

When she was 66 years old, Trichet undertook a long journey on horseback to visit all her communities, talk with the Sisters and inspire them. She always told the Sisters: "Your real Superior is Mary; I am but her servant." That was her last trip, for upon returning to the Mother House at Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre she never left again. An accidental fall caused her months of suffering, followed by a final illness from which she did not recover. On her deathbed she called a benefactor to beg that the poor of the parish be cared for, after her death.

Trichet died at Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre in Vendée on 28 April 1759, the same day and location where Louis de Montfort had died 43 years earlier on 28 April 1716.

On Trichet's death, the congregation included 174 sisters distributed in 36 communities and the Mother House. After the persecutions during the French Revolution, the Daughters of Wisdom regrouped and grew again. They were awarded medals by the governments of France, Spain, Prussia, and Belgium for nursing the wounded or plague-stricken soldiers of those countries on many occasions.

# Georg Anton Urlaub

On 13 October 1755, Urlaub married Anna Maria, who was also from Thüngersheim and was a distant cousin of his, requiring a dispensation. Their first child, Georg Adam Anton Urlaub, was born the following year and died on 17 August 1776. Their second child, Georg Hermann Joseph, was born in 1758 but died at six months of age on 28 October. Urlaub himself died in Würzburg on 20 February the following year. He was buried in the cemetery of the Dominican Abbey. In 1762 his widow married Johann Octavian Salver, who became archivist to the prince bishop in 1773.

# Edward Rich, 8th Earl of Warwick

He died on 7 September 1759, without male progeny, thus his titles became extinct. His monument survives in St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington. Later that year Francis Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, 1st Earl of Warwick successfully petitioned King George II for the vacant title of Earl of Warwick.

# Edward Wolfe

Edward Wolfe died on 26 March 1759 at the age of 74, while his son was crossing the Atlantic Ocean to assault French forces in Canada. During the campaign at Quebec, James Wolfe wore a black armband in mourning for his father. His own death while leading his troops to victory on the Plains of Abraham meant that father and son had both died in the "Year of Victories".
