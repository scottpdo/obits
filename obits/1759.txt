# Alamgir II

  Silver rupee issued in the name of Alamgir II, date of AH 1172 (c. 1758).


The newly appointed Mughal Grand Vizier after Ahmad Shah Durrani's invasion was Najib-ud-Daula who tried to consolidate the remains of the Mughal Empire by uniting distant Faujdars, Nawab's and Nizams into a common cause against the Marathas. Fearing their wrath the deposed Imad-ul-Mulk aligned himself with the Maratha leader Sadashivrao Bhau and launched an counterattack agianst Najib-ud-Daula which lasted 15 days and resulted in the defeat of Najib-ud-Daula who was drriven North. 

Imad-ul-Mulk then feared that the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II would recall Ahmad Shah Durrani, or use his son Prince Ali Gauhar, to dispossess him of his newfound power with the Marathas. Therefore, Imad-ul-Mulk plotted to murder the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and his family. A few Mughal Princes, including Ali Gauhar desperately managed to escape before assassination. In November 1759, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II was told that a pious man had come to meet him, Alamgir II, ever so eager to meet holy men, set out immediately to meet him at Kotla Fateh Shah, he was stabbed repeatedly by Imad-ul-Mulk's assassins. The Mughal Emperor Alamgir II's death was mourned throughout the Mughal Empire, particularly by the Muslim populace.

After the assassination of Alamgir II in 1759, the Peshwa under the sway of Sadashivrao Bhau had reached the peak of its short-lived power particularly when their involvement in the assassination had become eminent when he discussed abolishing the Mughal Empire and placing Vishwasrao on the throne in Delhi by bribing or deposing Imad-ul-Mulk.

# Eugene Aram

He was found guilty, and condemned to be executed on 6 August 1759, three days after his trial. While in his cell he confessed his guilt, and threw new light on the motives for his crime, by asserting that he had discovered an affair between Clark and his own wife. On the night before his execution he made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide by opening the veins in his arm with a razor.

Eugene Aram was hanged at York's Tyburn in an area of the Knavesmire on 16 August 1759. His skull is preserved in King's Lynn museum.

He left two daughters, one married (1744) to John Winter, brother to Richard Winter, who succeeded Bradbury, and father to Robert Winter, D.D., who succeeded Richard; the other daughter married (1768) George Welch, a banker. Besides the publications noticed above, Bradbury printed several funeral and other sermons, including two on the death of Robert Bragge (died 1738; "eternal Bragge" of Lime Street, who preached for four months on Joseph's coat).

# Peter Chartier

Peter Chartier was last seen in 1758 in a village on the Wabash River, however he is mentioned later in a 1760 letter from Governor-General Vaudreuil-Cavagnial:



"In the last days of the month of June of , five Chaouoinons [Shawnees] of [Chartier]'s band came...to ask him for a piece of ground, as theirs was not good. M. de MacCarty sent some provisions to those Indians, whom he placed near Fort Massac. They were more useful and less dangerous there than when collected together at Sonyote [Lower Shawneetown].


There is evidence that Chartier (as well as his mother Sewatha Straight Tail) died in an outbreak of smallpox that had originated in 1757 in Quebec and later spread to Native American communities across North America.

# Henry Darnall II

Henry Darnall II died in 1759, aged around 77. A small portion of Darnall's former property, now called Darnall's Chance, can still be visited today. No portrait of him survives.

# Ferdinand VI of Spain

The death of his wife Barbara, who had been devoted to him, and who carefully abstained from political intrigue, broke his heart. Between the date of her death in August 1758 and his own on 10 August 1759, he fell into a state of prostration in which he would not even dress, but wandered unshaven, unwashed and in a nightgown about his park. The memoirs of the count of Fernán Núñez give a shocking picture of his deathbed. As the couple had no children, Ferdinand VI of Spain was succeeded as King by his half-brother Charles III.

# Christopher Gist

It is said, that, during the summer of 1759, he contracted smallpox and died in Virginia, South Carolina, or Georgia. Other reports have him surviving until 1794 and dying in Cumberland, North Carolina (although this narrative may confuse Christopher son of Richard Gist with a cousin also named Christopher Gist, one of Richard's grandsons through Nathaniel Gist and Mary Howard).

# Giovanni Antonio Guadagni

He died in Rome in 1759 and was buried at the left side of the main altar in Santa Maria della Scala in the tomb that he had constructed for himself.
