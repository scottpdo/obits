# Samuel Bowen

Bowen died in London, England, on 30 December 1777. Two years later, his widow Jane became host to two officers from the fleet of Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing, at Greenwich during the Second Battle of Savannah. She supervised the burial of Polish General Casimir Pulaski, who was killed during the battle, "between her mansion and the river". Upon her death in 1782, she bequeathed her four children 26 slaves, 15 cows, and two oxen, along with a variety of machines for the processing of sago.

# John Cole (judge)

As the threat of war became imminent, Cole was appointed in 1775 as the Advocate General of the newly formed Vice Admiralty Court, and held this position until his death.  In 1777 he was urged to get inoculated for the serious smallpox disease, which was widespread at the time.  Instead of preventing the disease, Cole became infected, and died from it in October 1777.

# Ann Fenwick

Fenwick died in Hornby Hall on 28 April 1777 leaving detailed wills. She was buried with her parents in St Wilfrid's Church, Melling. The historian John Lingard who began an association with Hornby in 1811.

# James Ferguson, Lord Pitfour

Lord Pitfour suffered from poor health in his later years, and he resigned from the judiciary in 1776. Correspondence between Pitfour's two brothers-in-law, Lord Elibank and General Murray, shortly after Pitfour died describes how "he had in a manner lost his senses". After his death at Gilmerton on 25 June 1777, he was buried in a vault that he had paid to be built two years previously in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. One of several vaults situated in the southern boundary wall, it is described by Buchan as "a plain, even ugly, pitched-roof building". Fitted with a heavy freestone slab roof to hinder bodysnatchers, it bears the simple inscription: "Jacobus Ferguson de Pitfour. Sibi. conjugi, posterisque fecit. A. D. 1775." Also housed in the vault are the coffins of Pitfour's wife, two female relatives and two of Pitfour's sons. Lord Pitfour was succeeded by his eldest son, James.

# George I (Miskito)

George died during a smallpox epidemic in 1777, and was succeeded by his son George II Frederic.

# Thomas Gore (MP)

Gore died without issue on 17 March 1777. His brothers of John and  William Gore were also MPs.

# Button Gwinnett

In early 1777, Gwinnett and his allies gained control of the Georgia Provisional Congress, and he became acting President of the Congress and commander-in-chief of Georgia's military. As such, he was now the superior of his rival Lachlan McIntosh. Gwinnett had McIntosh's brother arrested and charged with treason. He also ordered McIntosh to lead an invasion of British-controlled East Florida, which failed. Gwinnett and McIntosh blamed each other for the defeat, and McIntosh publicly called Gwinnett "a scoundrel and lying rascal".

Gwinnett then challenged McIntosh to a duel, which they fought on May 16, 1777 at a plantation owned by deposed Royal Governor James Wright. The two men exchanged pistol shots at twelve paces, and both were wounded. Gwinnett died of his wounds on May 19, 1777, and was later buried in Savannah's Colonial Park Cemetery. McIntosh, although wounded, quickly recovered and went on to live until 1806. He was never charged in connection with Gwinnett's death.

Gwinnett was succeeded in his leadership position by fellow Revolutionary John Treutlen, who became the first person to hold the official title of "governor" of Georgia under American administration. (By coincidence, Treutlen himself was slain a few years later, reportedly by a mob.)

# Hossein Qoli Khan Qajar

During the following 10 years, Afsharid rule in Khorasan suffered heavily from war among rival chieftains and from invasions by the Durrani ruler of Qandahar, Ahmad Shah Durrani. During this period, Mohammad Hasan fought against the Pashtun military leader Azad Khan Afghan and the Zand ruler Karim Khan for suzerainty over the western part of Nader Shah's former empire. He was, however, defeated in 1759 by a Zand army, and thereafter betrayed by his own followers and killed by his old rival, Mohammad Khan of Savadkuh. Due to Agha Mohammad Khan's castration, Hossein Qoli Khan was appointed as the new chieftain of the Qoyunlu instead. Shortly thereafter Astarabad fell under the control of Karim Khan, who appointed a Develu named Hosayn Khan Develu as its governor. Meanwhile, Hossein Qoli Khan and his brother Agha Mohammad Khan fled to the steppe. One year later, Agha Mohammad Khan made an incursion against Astarabad, but was forced to flee, chased by the city's governor. Agha Mohammad Khan managed to reach Ashraf, but was at last seized and was sent as a hostage to Tehran, where Karim Khan was. Hossein Qoli Khan was also soon captured and sent to Karim Khan.

In 1763, Hossein Qoli Khan and  Agha Mohammad Khan were sent to the Zand capital, Shiraz, where their paternal aunt Khadijeh Begum, who was part of Karim Khan's harem, lived. Agha Mohammad Khan's half-brothers Morteza Qoli Khan and Mostafa Qoli Khan were granted permission to live in Astarabad, due to their mother being the sister of the governor of the city. His remaining brothers were sent to Qazvin, where they were treated honorably.

In February 1769, Karim Khan appointed Hossein Qoli Khan as the governor of Damghan. When Hossein Qoli Khan reached Damghan, he immediately began a fierce conflict with the Develu and other tribes to avenge his father's death. He was, however, killed ca. 1777 near Findarisk by some Turks from the Yamut tribe with whom he had clashed. He was survived by two sons—Hossein Qoli and Baba Khan (later known as Fath-Ali Shah Qajar).

# Nicholas Hyett

Hyett died in 1777. His Will is held by the British National Archives at Kew.

# Joseph I of Portugal

The reign of Joseph is also noteworthy for the Lisbon earthquake, firestorm and tsunami of 1 November 1755, in which between 30,000 and 40,000 people died.

The earthquake caused Joseph to develop a severe case of claustrophobia, and he was never again comfortable living within a walled building. Consequently, he moved the royal court to an extensive complex of tents in the hills of Ajuda.

The capital was eventually rebuilt at great cost, and an equestrian statue of King Joseph still dominates the Praça do Comércio, Lisbon's main plaza.

With Joseph's death on 24 February 1777, the throne passed to his daughter Maria I and brother/son-in-law Peter III. Pombal's iron rule was sharply brought to an end, because Maria disliked him since she had been heavily influenced by the Portuguese old nobility that strongly opposed Pombal.

# Eustachius De Lannoy

As a Christian, de Lannoy was prohibited from entering the king's palace at Padmanabhapuram  so he  resided  primarily at Udayagiri Fort, or De Lannoy Kotta (de Lannoy's Fort) as it is  known locally, where he also built a small chapel for his family and other Christians.

At some point of his military career, de Lannoy got well acquainted with Neelakanta Pillai, a Nair palace official, who after learning of Christian traditions and beliefs through de Lannoy, converted to Christianity. As they both had influential roles under the king, they got well acquainted. Neelankanta Pillai took the baptised name of Devasahayam Pillai.  The Roman Catholic church under Pope Benedict XVI made Devasahayam Pillai a beatified layman of the church in 2012, and he is likely to be made a saint in due course. Thus, de Lannoy had an important role in the Christian life of the Blessed Devasahayam Pillai.

Captain de Lannoy's military skills and loyalty were recognised not only by the king and his state officials, but also by the subjects of Travancore, who called him by the nom de guerre "Valiya  Kappithaan ", meaning 'The Great Captain'.

Maharaja Marthanda Varma died in 1758, and de Lannoy served as military chief to his successor Dharma Raja until his death.

De Lannoy  died in 1777 and was interred in the chapel within the Udayagiri Fort. The English translation of the Latin inscription on his tombstone runs:

# James Moore (Continental Army officer)

While preparing to march north in early 1777, Moore became ill.  He died of what was called "a fit of gout in his stomach" on about April 15, 1777.  Oral tradition holds that Moore died on the same day and in the same house as his brother, Maurice.  Anne, Moore's wife, died a few months thereafter.

Moore, who had not been directly involved in any military engagement during the Revolutionary War, was nonetheless able to construct a working military force out of the disparate parts provided for him by North Carolina.  Samuel A'Court Ashe, an early North Carolina historian, described Moore as "perhaps the most masterful military man furnished by North Carolina to the war of independence."  Another historian speculated that Moore's "actions had held the promise of greatness."  Moore's strategic command before and during the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge has been acclaimed as a major factor in the Patriot victory there.

The Wake Forest, North Carolina chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and a U.S. Army battery at the now defunct Fort Casey in Washington state were named in his honor.  In 1940, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources erected a North Carolina highway historical marker in Pender County near Moore's former home at Rocky Point commemorating his life and Revolutionary War service.

# Francis Nash

After the British captured Philadelphia on September 26, 1777, Washington took to the offensive and struck at the main part of the British Army near Philadelphia in the Battle of Germantown on October 4. Initially, the North Carolina brigade was intended to serve in the Continental Army's reserve but Washington, out of a desire to defend his flank, ordered Nash into action.  Nash was commanding a fighting retreat, slowly moving his unit backwards to stall the British advance, when he was mortally wounded by a cannonball that struck him in the hip and killed his horse. The same cannonball killed Major James Witherspoon, son of John Witherspoon, the president of Princeton University and a signer of the Declaration of Independence.  Nash may have also been blinded by a musket ball that struck him in the head. Thomas Paine, who saw him taken off the battlefield, later stated that Nash's wounds had made him unrecognizable.

Nash was treated by Washington's personal physician, James Craik, who could not stem his bleeding, which was reported to have fully soaked through two mattresses.  Nash succumbed to his wounds on October 7 at a private residence near Kulpsville, Pennsylvania. His final words are alleged to have been "From the first dawn of the Revolution I have been ever on the side of liberty and my country".  He was buried in the Towamencin Mennonite Meetinghouse Cemetery in Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania, on October 9, 1777, along with other officers who had perished at Germantown.  Most of the Continental Army's senior officers, including Washington himself, attended the funeral service.  Nash's friend and colleague Alexander Martin, who later became Governor of the State of North Carolina and who had witnessed Nash's wounding, later composed a funeral poem in the fallen general's honor.

# Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk

He  died on 20 September 1777, aged 91, without a male heir, when  several of his titles (the Dukedom of Norfolk, the Earldoms of Norfolk, Arundel and Surrey, and the Barony of Maltravers) passed to his kinsman, Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk. The Earldom of Norwich and Barony of Howard of Castle Rising, which were created for his grandfather, the 6th Duke of Norfolk, became extinct. Finally, three old English baronies by writ fell into abeyance among the daughters of his younger brother.

# Dolly Pentreath

In 1768, Daines Barrington searched Cornwall for speakers of the language and at Mousehole found Pentreath, then a fish seller said to be aged about 82, who "could speak Cornish very fluently." In 1775 he published an account of her in the Society of Antiquaries' journal Archaeologia in an article called "On the Expiration of the Cornish Language." Barrington noted that the "hut in which she lived was in a narrow lane," and that in two rather better cottages just opposite it he had found two other women, some ten or twelve years younger than Pentreath, who could not speak Cornish readily, but who understood it. Five years later, Pentreath was said to be 87 years old and at the time her hut was "poor and maintained mostly by the parish, and partly by fortune telling and gabbling Cornish."

In the last years of her life, Pentreath became a local celebrity for her knowledge of Cornish. Around 1777, she was painted by John Opie (1761–1807), and in 1781 an engraving of her after Robert Scaddan was published.

In 1797, a Mousehole fisherman told Richard Polwhele (1760–1838) that William Bodinar "used to talk with her for hours together in Cornish; that their conversation was understood by scarcely any one of the place; that both Dolly and himself could talk in English." Her own account as recorded by Daines Barrington indicates she also spoke English.

Dolly Pentreath has passed into legend for cursing people in a long stream of fierce Cornish whenever she became angry. Her death is seen as marking the death of Cornish as a community language.

There are many tales about her. She was said often to curse people, including calling them "kronnekyn hager du," an "ugly black toad," and was even said to have been a witch. Numerous other stories have been attached to her, their accuracy unknown. She was at one time thought to have been identical with a Dorothy Jeffrey or Jeffery whose burial is recorded in the Paul parish register, but this has been doubted (however the Oxford DNB (2004) does accept the identification).

# George Pigot, 1st Baron Pigot

Meantime Pigot died on 11 May 1777, while under confinement at the Company's Garden House, near Fort St. George, whither he had been allowed to return for change of air in the previous month. At the inquest held after his death, the jury recorded a verdict of willful murder against all those who had been concerned in Pigot's arrest. The real contest throughout had been between the Nawab of Arcot and the Raja of Tanjore. Members of the council took sides, and Pigot exceeded his powers while endeavouring to carry out the instructions of the directors. The proceedings before the coroner were held to be irregular by the supreme court of judicature in Bengal, and nothing came of the inquiry instituted by the company. On 16 April 1779, Admiral Hugh Pigot brought the subject of his brother's deposition before the House of Commons. A series of resolutions affirming the principal facts of the case was agreed to, and an address to the king, recommending the prosecution of Messrs. Stratton, Brooke, Floyer, and Mackay, who were at that time residing in England, was adopted. They were tried in the King's Bench before Lord Mansfield and a special jury in December 1779, and were found guilty of a misdemeanour in arresting, imprisoning, and deposing Lord Pigot. On being brought up for judgment on 10 February 1780, they were each sentenced to pay a fine of £1,000, on payment of which they were discharged.

# Mir Qasim

Plundered of most of his treasures, placed on a lame elephant and expelled by Shuja-ud-Daula after he had been routed at the Battle of Buxar, 23 October 1764; he fled to Rohilkhand, Allahabad, Gohad and Jodhpur, eventually settling at Kotwal, near Delhi ca. 1774.

Mir Qasim died in obscurity and abject poverty possibly from dropsy, at Kotwal, near Delhi on 8 May 1777. His two shawls, the only property left by him, had to be sold to pay for his funeral.

# Sir Thomas Robinson, 1st Baronet

Robinson died at his house at Chelsea on 3 March 1777, aged 76, without leaving legitimate issue, and was buried in the south-east corner of the chancel of Merton church, a monument being placed there to his memory. A second monument was erected for him in Westminster Abbey, about 1778, with two portrait busts by John Walsh, commemorating also his first wife.

Robinson's reputation was as a "specious, empty man", with a talent for flattery. He was tall and thin, while his contemporary of the same name Thomas Robinson, 1st Baron Grantham was short and fat. "I can't imagine", said the witty Lady Townshend, "why one is preferred to the other. The one is as broad as the other is long".

# John Rosbrugh

The afternoon of January 2 found the American lines, on the south side of Assunpink creek, preparing their positions for the upcoming battle. Rev. John Rosbrugh was dining at a public house when the warning was given that Hessians were coming. Going outside he found his horse had been taken and he was suddenly confronted by a company of Hessians under the command of a British officer. He surrendered but they recognized him as a Presbyterian minister and bayonetted him to death on the spot.[a] His executioners took his watch, money and left his body naked in the snow. Captain Hays, on hearing of the death of his pastor wrapped the body and quickly buried him where he fell. The next morning Rev. George Duffield, a brother Presbyterian chaplain took the body of his friend and reburied him in the graveyard of the First Presbyterian Church of Trenton. It is believed he still rests there today with his grave marked by a stone shaped as a clock. His widow, Jane (née Ralston) survived him by 32 years, passing away on 27 March 1809. She rests in the East Allen Township cemetery, the inscription on her tombstone indicating her husband John is buried beside her.

# Philippe Charles Tronson du Coudray

On September 11, 1777, he was riding across a pontoon bridge across the Schuylkill River when his horse suddenly became alarmed, leaping into the river.  Du Coudray, caught in spurs and entanglements, drowned.  His funeral, held at St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia, was attended by many Congressional representatives.  He was buried in the church yard, but the exact grave location is unknown.
