# Samuel Bowen

Bowen died in London, England, on 30 December 1777. Two years later, his widow Jane became host to two officers from the fleet of Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing, at Greenwich during the Second Battle of Savannah. She supervised the burial of Polish General Casimir Pulaski, who was killed during the battle, "between her mansion and the river". Upon her death in 1782, she bequeathed her four children 26 slaves, 15 cows, and two oxen, along with a variety of machines for the processing of sago.

# John Cole (judge)

As the threat of war became imminent, Cole was appointed in 1775 as the Advocate General of the newly formed Vice Admiralty Court, and held this position until his death.  In 1777 he was urged to get inoculated for the serious smallpox disease, which was widespread at the time.  Instead of preventing the disease, Cole became infected, and died from it in October 1777.
