# Sultan Husayn

To begin with, Mahmud treated Sultan Husayn considerately, but as he gradually became mentally unbalanced he began to view the former shah with suspicion. In February 1725, believing a rumour that one of Sultan Husayn's sons, Safi Mirza, had escaped, Mahmud ordered the execution of all the other Safavid princes who were in his hands, with the exception of Sultan Husayn himself. When Sultan Husayn tried to stop the massacre, he was wounded, but his action saved the lives of two of his young children. Mahmud succumbed to insanity and died on 25 April of the same year.

Mahmud's successor Ashraf at first treated the deposed shah with sympathy. In return, Sultan Husayn gave him the hand of one of his daughters in marriage, a move which would have increased Ashraf's legitimacy in the eyes of his Persian subjects. However, Ashraf was involved in a war with the Ottoman Empire, which contested his claim to the Persian throne. In the autumn of 1726, the Ottoman governor of Baghdad, Ahmad Pasha, advanced with his army on Isfahan, sending a message to Ashraf saying that he was coming to reinstate the rightful shah of Persia. In response, Ashraf had Sultan Husayn's head cut off and sent it to the Ottoman with the message that "he expected to give Ahmad Pasha a fuller reply with the points of his sword and his lance". As Michael Axworthy comments, "In this way Shah Soltan Hossein gave in death a sharper answer than he ever gave in life".

# Sir Nicholas Morice, 2nd Baronet

# Konstanty Władysław Sobieski

Suffering from rheumatism and seriously indebted, in 1725 Sobieski unexpectedly made amends with his wife, who offered him financial aid and brought him from Wrocław to Żółkiew, where he died and was buried in the parish church. The Żółkiew residence owes to Sobieski its impressive painting collection and abundant library.

# Sophia Dorothea of Celle

Sophia Dorothea fell ill in August 1726. She died aged 60 on 13 November 1726 of liver failure and gall bladder occlusion.[citation needed]

George placed an announcement in The London Gazette to the effect that the "Duchess of Ahlden" had died, but would not allow the wearing of mourning in London or Hanover. He was furious when he heard that his daughter's court in Berlin wore black. Sophia Dorothea's body was put into a casket and deposited in the castle's cellar. It was quietly moved to Celle in May 1727 to be buried beside her parents in the Stadtkirche. George I died four weeks later while visiting Hanover.

# John Stewart (of Livingstone)

Stewart was a burgess of Edinburgh in 1708, and of Glasgow in 1716. He was a commissioner of supply for Kirkcudbright Stewartry in 1706. He held land both in Livingstone in Kirkcudbright and at Stewartfield in Jedburgh, the first inherited from his father, and the latter through his marriage in 1704 to Elizabeth Scott, the daughter and heir of Sir Francis Scott of Mangerton in Roxburghshire.

Those landholding qualified him as a freeholder, with a vote in each county's elections. After the by-election in Roxburghshire in 1726, a meeting of the county's freeholders was followed by a dinner.  One of those present was the by-election winner Sir Gilbert Eliott, 3rd Baronet, of Stobs, who complained to Stewart for not voting for him.  An argument followed, and Stewart threw a glass of wine in Eliott's face, who responded by running his sword through the seated Stewart.

Stewart managed to stand and return two blows before the two men were separated, but the wound was fatal. Stewart's dying words were that he had been murdered sitting in his chair, and that his assailant was Sir Gilbert Eliott.

Eliott was declared an outlaw, and escaped into exile before being given a royal pardon.

# Lady Mary Tudor

Lady Mary died in Paris on 5 November 1726, aged 53.[citation needed]

# Antoni de Villarroel

Villarroel was imprisoned first in the castle of Alicante and later (1715) in A Coruña, where he died (22 February 1726). He spent his last years confined in a cell that flooded with the rising tide, circumstance that caused a total paralysis of his two legs. The actual date of his death was discovered by Josep Catà and Antoni Muñoz in 2009. Until then, it was considered that Villarroel had been released from the Alcazar of Segovia following the peace of Vienna and had lived in the pension that would have granted, until his death, the Archduke Charles Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.

# Galfridus Walpole

Walpole died without issue on 7 August 1726.

# Richard West (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)

In November 1726 West became ill, but since he was still only about thirty-five,  and seemed to  be responding well  to treatment,  his case was not thought to be  serious; on 3 December however he unexpectedly died. Rumours that he was poisoned, whether by his wife or by a political enemy, are  without foundation. He is buried in St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street, Dublin.

His early death left his family in severe financial difficulty, especially as his father, who outlived him by a few months, left no will and according to their legal advice West's widow and children had no claim to his estate.  What had become of his widow's own money is unclear, but it should  certainly have been enough to live on: her Dutch  mother Mary Scott had been a great heiress, and her father the Bishop in his own  will had provided generously for all his children.

Mrs West's reputation also suffered from rumours, almost certainly  false, that she was having an affair with her husband's secretary John Williams, later her son-in-law, and even wilder rumours that they had poisoned him. King George I was persuaded to grant her a pension, which George II continued. Despite the pension she fell on hard times and spent her last years  as a dependent of Josiah Tucker, the Dean of Gloucester.
