He died in Rome on 16 January 1739 aged sixty-five.  He left an endowment to be administered by the "de Propaganda Fide" college in Rome to support to English students as Roman Catholic missionaries in Rome.
His funerary monument is in the Venerabile Collegio Inglese (Venerable English College) in Rome.

# Jeremiah Dummer

Jeremiah Dummer died an unmarried man on May 19, 1739, in Essex, England.  He left instructions to the executors of his will to "invite to my funeral all such New England Gentlemen as shall be in London at the time of my decease" and to reward each with a ring of the value of 20 shillings.  The mode with which Dummer dealt with his death reflects his crucial role in early 18th century colonial history.  He was very attached to his native New England and his most significant contribution to history was A Defense of the New-England Charters, which was revived and republished during the American Revolution by John Adams.  In both his support for the colonial charters and his role in securing a college in New Haven, his dedication to New England is as important as it is often unrecognized.  Although the college was not named for him, Dummer's persuasion of Elihu Yale's support cemented its future.  Even if not directly stated, the New England colonies also had Dummer to thank for the continuation of their charters.

Most visible memorials in New England bearing the name Dummer are to his brother William, for whom Dummerston, Vermont and Dummer, New Hampshire are named.  (The Indian war sometimes known as Dummer's War is also named for William, who was acting governor for much of the period.)  Governor Dummer's Academy, now Governor's Academy, is another visible memorial.

Jeremiah Dummer, Jr. left his mark on history by not only being the first American colonist to receive a Ph. D. from a European university, but also by remaining until his death one of the colonies' fiercest champions in the securing of their future.

In the 1920s during a period of increased interested in early American painting a quantity of worthless eighteenth century paintings were bought in London, then signed with the name of Dummer and passed off on critics and collectors. William Sawitzky of the New York Historical Association found contradictions in the dossiers and exposed the fraud.

# Emine Sultan

Emine Sultan died in 1739, and was buried in Mevlevihane Kapısı, Istanbul.

# Sampson Estwick

He died on 16 February 1738-9. The ‘reverend and truly venerable Mr. Estwick’ was regretted by the author of the Remarks as a ‘good man and worthy clergyman,’ while the ‘London Evening Post’ of 20 February bears witness to his ‘exemplary piety and orthodox principles.’ Estwick was said by Hawkins to have been an unsuccessful candidate for Gresham Professor of Music. He attended all the early meetmgs (from the first held in January 1725-6) of the Academy of Vocal Musick, and his name heads the list of contributors.

His sermon on ‘The Usefulness of Church Musick,’ preached at Christ Church, 27 November 1696, upon the occasion of the anniversary meeting of the lovers of music on St. Cecilia's day, was published in the same year by request of the stewards. In the dedicatory letter, Estwick deplores the tendency of the age to ‘a neglect, if not a disuse, of church musick.’ Another sermon delivered at St. Paul's, was published in 1698. His manuscript music is preserved at the Music School, and at Christ Church Library, Oxford; it includes a motet, songs, and odes to be performed at the Acts.

# Thomas Lombe

Lombe was an alderman of Bassishaw ward in the city of London, and was chosen sheriff of London in 1727. He was knighted on 8 July of the same year, when he attended at court to present a congratulatory address from the city to George II on his accession. He died on 8 January 1739 at his house in Old Jewry.
