# Sir Thomas Dereham, 4th Baronet

Dereham did not marry.  
He died in Rome on 16 January 1739 aged sixty-five.  He left an endowment to be administered by the "de Propaganda Fide" college in Rome to support to English students as Roman Catholic missionaries in Rome.
His funerary monument is in the Venerabile Collegio Inglese (Venerable English College) in Rome.

# Jeremiah Dummer

Jeremiah Dummer died an unmarried man on May 19, 1739, in Essex, England.  He left instructions to the executors of his will to "invite to my funeral all such New England Gentlemen as shall be in London at the time of my decease" and to reward each with a ring of the value of 20 shillings.  The mode with which Dummer dealt with his death reflects his crucial role in early 18th century colonial history.  He was very attached to his native New England and his most significant contribution to history was A Defense of the New-England Charters, which was revived and republished during the American Revolution by John Adams.  In both his support for the colonial charters and his role in securing a college in New Haven, his dedication to New England is as important as it is often unrecognized.  Although the college was not named for him, Dummer's persuasion of Elihu Yale's support cemented its future.  Even if not directly stated, the New England colonies also had Dummer to thank for the continuation of their charters.

Most visible memorials in New England bearing the name Dummer are to his brother William, for whom Dummerston, Vermont and Dummer, New Hampshire are named.  (The Indian war sometimes known as Dummer's War is also named for William, who was acting governor for much of the period.)  Governor Dummer's Academy, now Governor's Academy, is another visible memorial.

Jeremiah Dummer, Jr. left his mark on history by not only being the first American colonist to receive a Ph. D. from a European university, but also by remaining until his death one of the colonies' fiercest champions in the securing of their future.

In the 1920s during a period of increased interested in early American painting a quantity of worthless eighteenth century paintings were bought in London, then signed with the name of Dummer and passed off on critics and collectors. William Sawitzky of the New York Historical Association found contradictions in the dossiers and exposed the fraud.

# Emine Sultan

Emine Sultan died in 1739, and was buried in Mevlevihane Kapısı, Istanbul.

# Sampson Estwick

He died on 16 February 1738-9. The ‘reverend and truly venerable Mr. Estwick’ was regretted by the author of the Remarks as a ‘good man and worthy clergyman,’ while the ‘London Evening Post’ of 20 February bears witness to his ‘exemplary piety and orthodox principles.’ Estwick was said by Hawkins to have been an unsuccessful candidate for Gresham Professor of Music. He attended all the early meetmgs (from the first held in January 1725-6) of the Academy of Vocal Musick, and his name heads the list of contributors.

His sermon on ‘The Usefulness of Church Musick,’ preached at Christ Church, 27 November 1696, upon the occasion of the anniversary meeting of the lovers of music on St. Cecilia's day, was published in the same year by request of the stewards. In the dedicatory letter, Estwick deplores the tendency of the age to ‘a neglect, if not a disuse, of church musick.’ Another sermon delivered at St. Paul's, was published in 1698. His manuscript music is preserved at the Music School, and at Christ Church Library, Oxford; it includes a motet, songs, and odes to be performed at the Acts.

# Thomas Lombe

Lombe was an alderman of Bassishaw ward in the city of London, and was chosen sheriff of London in 1727. He was knighted on 8 July of the same year, when he attended at court to present a congratulatory address from the city to George II on his accession. He died on 8 January 1739 at his house in Old Jewry.

# Sir Roger Mostyn, 3rd Baronet

Mostyn died on 5 May 1739, at his seat in Carnarvonshire and was buried at Llanrhos, Caernarvonshire. By his wife who died of smallpox on 23 May 1721 he had six sons and six daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas, with the death of whose grandson Thomas in 1831 the baronetcy became extinct. Three of his other sons were unmarried: Roger was a Canon of Windsor, Savage Mostyn was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy, and John Mostyn was an officer in the British Army and a Member of Parliament. His daughter Essex Mostyn (died 7 December 1764) married Robert Ker, second Duke of Roxburghe, and had issue.

# Crewe Offley

Offley died on 28 June 1739 leaving two sons. His son John inherited Wychnor and sold it in 1765 to John Levett.

# Saliha Sultan (wife of Mustafa II)

In 1739, Saliha was struck 
by an unknown severe illness, and was transferred to the Tırnakçı Palace in the hope that she would rehabilitate there.  However, she died on 21 September 1739. She was buried in the mausoleum of Turhan Hatice Sultan, New Mosque, Istanbul.

# Tomochichi

Tomochichi died on October 5, 1739, and while sources differ over his exact age, historians and contemporary observers generally agree that he was in his late nineties. Before he died in 1739, he told the Creek Indians to remember how well the King treated them and he hoped that they would remain friends forever. He was given a public funeral by the colony. His contributions to the colony of Georgia were celebrated with an English military funeral, and the grave site was commemorated with a marker of "a Pyramid of Stone" collected from the vicinity. Senauki, his wife, and his nephew, Toonahowi, were left in charge of the tribe, but he appointed no one to take his place as the impartial mediator between the Indians and the English.

The monument marking his gravesite was destroyed under unknown circumstances, the last known mention of the pyramid being in 1759. In the early 1870s, another monument was built on the site, this time an earthen mound with a decorative planter in the center, identical to at least four other mounds and planters built in other local squares. The planter is commonly mis-identified as the monument to Tomochichi, a mistake that arises from a 1937 Savannah Morning News article. The planter was later removed to make way for a much larger monument to William Washington Gordon, the founder of the Central of Georgia Railroad and the grandfather of Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts. Upset with the lack of monument for Tomochichi, Gordon's daughter-in-law, Nellie Gordon, had a new monument to his memory, a large granite boulder with a decorative copper plate, installed southeast of the original structure on April 21, 1899, by the Colonial Dames of America. The Georgia Historical Commission later placed a large marker in Savannah's Wright Square, which details the achievements of the Yamacraw chieftain.

Savannah's Tomochichi Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse was named in his honor.

# Roger Tuckfield

Tuckfield died unmarried on 26 March 1739. He left Ashburton to his sister Margaret, the wife of John Harris, on whose death in 1754 it was inherited by her daughter, by her first husband, Margaret Rolle, 15th Baroness Clinton, the wife of Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford. Raddon went to his cousin John Tuckfield.
