John Hely



Within a few years,   despite his relative youth,  his health failed. In 1701,  although he felt well enough to travel on the spring assizes,  he fell ill at Ennis and died "after two days sickness" at the house of  Mr David England, who was later paid Â£3 for caring for him.  Burke suggests that  Hely, like many judges of the time, found  that the strain of going on assize (in particular  enduring the ordeal  of  the notoriously  bad Irish  roads)   was too much for his constitution to bear.

About 1698 the Irish born writer and publisher John Dunton, on a visit to Dublin, gave a sketch of the Irish judiciary and praised  most of them, including Hely, as "men of such reputation that no one complains of them". On the other hand, Ball  rather cynically notes that the general reaction to the news of his sudden death was not  so much grief as a widespread interest in who would be appointed to  fill his place.

His widow remarried James de Lestrille: they were named as co-defendants in her sons' lawsuit against her brother Henry in 1717.
