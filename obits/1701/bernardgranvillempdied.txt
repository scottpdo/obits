Granville died on 14 June 1701, aged 71 and was buried on 22 June 1701 in St Mary's Church, Lambeth, Surrey, next to Lambeth Palace, the London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was buried in the same grave as his father-in-law who died in 1699 and his wife, who died on 20 September 1701. His monument is described in Thomas Allen's 1827 work History and Antiquities of the Parish of Lambeth, 1827 as "a beautiful monument of white marble ornamented with cherubs, fruit, flowers, etc.", situated on the "north side of the stairs leading to the north gallery". In 1872 it was described as "out of sight and partially dismantled". No mention was made of it in the 1951 work Survey of London: Church of St Mary, Lambeth.
