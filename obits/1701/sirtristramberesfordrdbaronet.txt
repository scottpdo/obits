Sir Tristram Beresford, 3rd Baronet



In February 1687, he married Nichola Sophia Hamilton, youngest daughter of Hugh Hamilton, 1st Viscount of Glenawly,  who spent most of his career in the Swedish  army, and his second wife Susanna Balfour,  and had by her four daughters and a son. His wife grew up with John Power, 2rd Earl of Tyrone and according to a family legend they both agreed in their childhood, that whoever should die at first, should try to return and report to the other about the afterlife. In October 1693, Nichola wore one morning a black ribbon and after a request by her husband, declared that her friend had died. Shortly thereafter a letter from the earl's steward arrived, confirming her assertion. She also predicted Beresford the birth of his son and when in 1713, a clergyman presented her documents, which changed her age to forty-seven, she announced her oncoming death. Nichola told a female friend, that in the night after the earl's death, his ghost had manifested and had given her information about her future life. As a proof, that it had been no dream, a black mark then appeared at her wrist, which she later covered with a ribbon. Following this explanation Nichola expired in the presence of her friend.

Beresford himself died in 1701 and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Marcus, later raised to the Peerage of Ireland by the title Earl of Tyrone. Nichola  remarried General Richard  Gorges  of Kilbrew, County Meath,  and  had a further  six children.  Despite the romantic family  legend, her death in 1713 was probably in childbirth with her youngest daughter Lucy, who  married  firstly William St Lawrence, 14th Baron Howth, and secondly Nicholas Weldon.
