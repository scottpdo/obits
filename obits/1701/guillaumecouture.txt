Guillaume Couture



On November 18, 1700, Couture's wife, Anne, died. In the spring of 1701, Couture was 83 years old and ill, possibly from small pox. He was moved to the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, where he died on April 4, 1701. The location of his tomb is unknown, as is the location of the tomb of Samuel de Champlain, founder of Quebec City. There is a park dedicated to Couture in Levis.
