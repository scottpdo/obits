Joseph Williamson (politician)



Williamson died at Cobham, Kent, on 3 October 1701, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his widow joined him a year later. He had become very rich by taking advantage of the many opportunities of making money which his official position gave him; and despite the heavy debts left by her brother, his wife is also said to have brought him a fortune. He left £6,000 and his library to Queen's College, Oxford; £5,000 to found a school at Rochester, Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School; and £2,000 to Thetford. A great number of Williamson's letters, dispatches, memoranda, etc., are among the English state papers.

He has been described as one of the greatest English civil servants of his time,  and is  credited with building up an intelligence service as efficient as that which John Thurloe had operated  under  Oliver Cromwell. His detailed notes of Privy Council meetings are an invaluable source of information about its operation, especially in the political crisis of 1678–79.  On the other hand he was a poor public speaker: even Charles II, himself a very hesitant speaker, complained of his "droning".

Despite his gifts he was not popular, being described as dry, formal and arrogant, an uncertain friend and a harsh employer. Many of his colleagues,  like Sir Leoline Jenkins,   felt the lash of his sharp tongue.  On the other hand, his will, in which he remembered all those who had a claim on him, suggests that he did not lack a certain generosity of character; and he was capable of forming lifelong friendships, notably with Samuel Pepys.
