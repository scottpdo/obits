Creswell Levinz



He at once returned to the bar, and was soon busily engaged in pleading. He was one of the counsel for the Seven Bishops in 1688, defended Major John Bernardi (an alleged conspirator in the Jacobite Assassination Plot), securing the dismissal of the bill of indictment by the grand jury and, in the great habeas corpus case of Rex v. Kendall and Roe, before Lord Chief Justice Holt in 1695, he argued successfully against the legality of a committal to prison under a general warrant by a secretary of state. He died at Serjeants' Inn on 29 Jan. 1700â€“1, and was buried in Evenley parish church. Part of his monument there survives: a more than life-size marble statue of Levinz wearing his judge's robes and wig. He was succeeded by his son William who was a Nottinghamshire MP.
