# Marie-Josephte Corriveau

Corriveau married at the age of 16, on November 17, 1749, to Charles Bouchard, aged 23, also a farmer. Three children were born in this marriage: two daughters, Marie-Françoise (1752) and Marie-Angélique (1754), followed by a son, Charles (1757). Rumors (that only started after the death of her second husband) say that she murdered him, as there is no concrete record of his death. Charles Bouchard was buried on April 27, 1760, and she remarried fifteen months later, on July 20, 1761, to another farmer from Saint-Vallier, Louis Étienne Dodier. On the morning of January 27, 1763, he was found dead in his barn, with multiple head wounds. Despite an official recording of the cause of death being from kicks of horses' hooves, and a speedy burial, rumours and gossip of murder spread rapidly through the neighbourhood. Dodier was on bad terms with his father-in-law and with his wife.

# Hannah Dagoe

Hannah Dagoe was born in Ireland, and was of that numerous class of women who plied at Covent Garden Market as "basket-women", or porters.

Dagoe had previously been incarcerated for debt in Whitechapel Jail, where she married a fellow prisoner, a Spanish seaman, "Diego" or "Dago", from whom she took her surname.  After he either left the country or died, she took up with the keeper of the prisoner, one William Connor.  She was a strong, masculine woman and the terror of her fellow-prisoners, one of whom she stabbed in a quarrel. For this she was sent to Newgate prison for six months, where she stabbed another man, for no personal provocation, but because he had turned evidence against his accomplices. She was also imprisoned at the Poultry Compter several times.

She became acquainted with a poor and industrious woman of the name of Eleanor Hussey, who lived by herself in a small apartment, in which was some creditable household furniture, the remains of the worldly goods of her deceased husband. Seizing an opportunity, when the owner was from home, this daring woman broke into Hussey's room and stripped it of every article which it contained.

We have adduced many instances of the hardness of heart, and contempt of the commandments of God, in men who have undergone the last sentence of the law; but we are of opinion that in this female will be found a more relentless heart, in her last moments, than any criminal whom we have yet recorded.
The Newgate Calendar




For this burglary and robbery she was brought to trial at the Old Bailey, found guilty, and sentenced to death.

The day before she was due to die, James Boswell saw Dagoe in the courtyard of Newgate prison, remarking in his diary that she was a "big unconcerned thing". Although present at the execution, Boswell curiously did not record the unusual manner of her death.

On the road to Tyburn she showed little concern at her miserable state, and paid no attention to the exhortations of the Romish priest who attended her. When the cart, in which she was bound, was drawn under the gallows, she got her hands and arms loose, seized the executioner, struggled with him, and gave him so violent a blow on the breast that she nearly knocked him down. She dared him to hang her; and in order to revenge herself upon him, and cheat him of his dues, she took off her hat, cloak and other parts of her dress, and disposed of them among the crowd. After much resistance he got the rope about her neck, which she had no sooner found accomplished than, pulling out a hand kerchief, she bound it round her head and over her face, and threw herself out of the cart, before the signal was given, with such violence that she broke her neck and died instantly.

# Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont

  Duff House mausoleum

By his second wife Jean he had five sons and six daughters. The eldest, James, succeeded his father as Earl. On his death without issue in 1809, he was succeeded by his younger brother Alexander. Another son, Arthur, became a member of Parliament.

# John Finch (died 1763)

Finch died on 12 February 1763, leaving a daughter born before marriage, whose presentation at court in 1747 created controversy in the family. As well as Lord Finch and Henry, his brothers Edward and William Finch were also Members of Parliament.

# Peter Forsskål

On Michaelis' recommendation, and with Linnaeus's approval, Forsskål the next year (1760) was appointed by king Frederick V of Denmark to join, amongst others, the orientalist and mathematician Carsten Niebuhr on an expedition to Arabia. The group first went to Egypt where they stayed for about a year, with Forsskål pursuing studies in Arabic dialects, and arrived in South Arabia (Arabia Felix, present-day Yemen) at the end of December 1762. Just 31 years old, Forsskål worked hard on collecting botanical and zoological specimens, but fell ill with malaria and died in July 1763. He was buried at night in Yarim, Yemen.

Linnaeus mourned the death of his young student and named one of the plants Forsskål had sent home Forsskaolea tenacissima because the plant was as stubborn and persistent as the young Swede had been.

The entire journey of this Danish expedition was the subject of Thorkild Hansen's first book, Det lykkelige Arabien (1962, translated into English as Arabia Felix).

# Michael Foster (English judge)

Foster died on 7 November 1763, in the seventy-fourth year of his age, and was buried in the parish church of Stanton Drew in Somersetshire, where a monument was erected to his memory. In 1725 he married Martha, the eldest daughter of James Lyde of Stantonwick, Somersetshire. She died on 15 May 1758. There were no children of the marriage. An engraving by James Basire, from an original picture of Foster, then in the possession of Mrs. Dodson, forms the frontispiece to his Life.
