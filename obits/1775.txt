However, in 1821 a canal was built through the land and his body was placed on show by the landowner until Baskerville's family and friends arranged to have it moved to the crypt of Christ Church, Birmingham. Christ Church was demolished in 1897 so his remains were then moved, with other bodies from the crypt, to consecrated catacombs at Warstone Lane Cemetery.  In 1963 a petition was presented to Birmingham City Council requesting that he be reburied in unconsecrated ground according to his wishes. 

Baskerville House was built on the grounds of Easy Hill. In 1947, BBC radio broadcast a radio play about his burial, named Hic Jacet: or The Corpse in the Crescent by Neville Brendon Watts. The original recording was not preserved but a performance was staged by students at the Birmingham School of Acting in 2013 at the Typographic Hub Centre of Birmingham City University.

He was so much "shaken in health" that he decided to go abroad, thinking that a change of scenery would be beneficial. Before he left, however, he wanted to make sure that none of children suffered so much, so he ordered the inoculation of Princess Sophia and Princess Caroline, which was performed on 3 March. Princess Sophia, aged two at the time, survived and the inoculation had no known repercussion on her. However, Princess Caroline, became seriously ill on 13 March, having seizures and fits. Princess Caroline of Gloucester died on 14 March, aged almost nine months. She was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.
