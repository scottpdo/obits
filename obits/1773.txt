# Abraham van der Weijden

In January 1773 van der Weijden and other Ship Captains we invited for lunch by Governor Joachim van Plettenberg. Van der Weijden had a difference of opinion with Carl Phillip Cassel, also a shipâ€™s captain. Cassel stabbed him to death and fled to France. He was the recipient of the first Masonic funeral in South Africa.

# Andrew Brice

His dramatic tastes and his charitable feelings constantly involved him in pecuniary difficulties and obliged him to prosecute his trade until he was the oldest master printer in England. By this time he was left without wife or children, and he parted with his business for a weekly annuity and retired to a country house near Exeter. He died on 7 November 1773, and his body lay in state in an inn at Exeter, every person who came to see it paying a shilling to defray the cost of the funeral. As Brice was the oldest freemason in England, three hundred members of that body escorted his coffin to the grave in Bartholomew churchyard on 14 November. His books were sold in the following year.

# Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield

The 4th Earl of Chesterfield (Philip Dormer Stanhope) died on 24 March 1773, at Chesterfield House, Westminster, his London townhouse (built about 1749). His godson and adopted heir then became Lord Philip Stanhorpe, 5th Earl of Chesterfield.

# Philibert Commerson

Commerson died at Mauritius at the age of 45. His extensive collections from the voyage did not, unfortunately, receive their deserved recognition. Although his numerous manuscripts and herbaria were brought to Paris after his death they were never systematically organized and evaluated. Unaware of his death in 1773, the Paris Academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow botanist just a few months later.:93



The standard author abbreviation Comm. is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.

# John Cunningham (poet and dramatist)

John Cunningham gave his last performance as an actor in Darlington on 20 June 1773. He returned to Newcastle, was taken ill, and died on 18 September 1773 at the age of 44, at his lodgings in Union Street, Newcastle.

He was buried at St John's Churchyard, a monument being placed at his grave by Mr. Slack, of the Newcastle Chronicle. This monument was restored in 1887 by public subscription, after falling into decay. In 1891 The Chronicle's current proprietor, Joseph Cowen, placed a memorial window in St John's Church in his memory.

# Walter Dulany

Walter Dulany died on September 20, 1773.
In 1808 the younger Walter Dulany sold his family house at Windmill Point to the United States Government, which assigned the house to the commander of Fort Severn which was subsequently built there. After 1845 the house was occupied by the various superintendents of the United States Naval Academy.
