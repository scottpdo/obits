He died on 7 November 1773, and his body lay in state in an inn at Exeter, every person who came to see it paying a shilling to defray the cost of the funeral. As Brice was the oldest freemason in England, three hundred members of that body escorted his coffin to the grave in Bartholomew churchyard on 14 November. His books were sold in the following year.

During this time, Waddell assisted in the establishment of a Sons of Liberty organization based around the Wilmington area, and participated in protests against the Stamp Act of 1765.  Waddell died after a prolonged battle with an illness on April 9, 1773, in Castle Hayne, North Carolina where he is buried.
