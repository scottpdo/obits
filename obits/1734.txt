# James Hamilton, 6th Earl of Abercorn

In 1673 his father died of a wound received at the Battle of Schooneveld. He was compensated by an appointment as an extra groom of the bedchamber on 18 April 1680. Charles II issued a warrant on 22 January 1683/4 to create Hamilton "Baron Hamilton of Bellamont", county Dublin, in the Irish peerage, but it never passed the seals, and his post in the bedchamber terminated on the king's death in 1685.

# Waller Bacon

Waller died on 11 November 1734, leaving two surviving sons.

# John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington

Barrington died on 14 December 1734. He married Anne Daines, daughter of Sir William Daines, in 1713. Their five sons all gained distinction. 

Their daughter Anne married the Hon. Thomas Clarges, son of Sir Thomas Clarges.

# Alexis Simon Belle

When Belle died in 1734, he was described as "painter to the king in his Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, comptroller of clergy stipends and comptroller of poultry", so his royal connections had evidently led to offices of profit under the crown.

Belle died at Paris in 1734. His funeral is again recorded in some detail in the parish register of the church of Saint-Sulpice, as quoted in Eugène Piot's Le Cabinet de l'amateur. This states that Belle was buried on 22 November 1734. Apart from describing him as painter to the king in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, comptroller of clergy stipends and of poultry, the register entry says that Belle was the husband of Marie-Nicole Hortemels and had died at his house in the rue du Four on the previous day, 21 November. His age is given as "about 60 years, 10 months, 8 days", and it is also recorded that the funeral was attended by Clément Louis Marie Anne Belle and "N. Belle, privately baptized, aged 7 years", sons, and by "Fréderic-Eustache-Auguste Hortemels, copperplate engraver, Denis Hortemels, bookseller, Nicolas Tardien and Charles-Nicolas Cochin, engravers to the king, both brothers-in law to the deceased".

Belle's son Clément-Louis became a history painter. When he died in 1806, he was described as "Rector of the Special School of Painting, Sculpture, Architecture and Engraving, and Professor of Design to the Imperial Manufactury of Gobelins".

# Charles Calvert (governor)

Captain Calvert suffered from early senility and died on February 2, 1734, aged 42. He had arrived in Maryland a relatively poor man, but died one of the wealthiest men in the Province. On his death his estate was appraised at 4,401 pounds sterling. His wife Rebecca died soon afterwards, and in 1737 their daughter Anne died, leaving their last remaining child Elizabeth an orphan, but a wealthy heiress.

# Pynsent Chernock

Chernock did not stand again until 1713. By this time, the deaths of the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Bolingbroke had disordered the Whig nobility of the county, of which the Duke of Kent became effective leader. The increasing popularity and local organization of the Tories allowed Chernock and Harvey to triumph narrowly over the Whig candidates, John Cater and William Hillersden. Again, Chernock was relatively inactive in Parliament, managing a bill on Bedfordshire highways. His support for the Tory candidates in Bedford failed to secure them that seat in the 1715 election, and he himself was defeated in Bedfordshire by Hillersden. This marked the end of his active political involvement, although the Jacobites reported him a likely sympathizer with their cause in 1721. He died at his seat, where he was buried, on 2 September 1734. His son succeeded him in the estate and baronetcy.

# Hugh Boscawen, 1st Viscount Falmouth

Boscawen died suddenly at Trefusis, in Cornwall, aged 54, and was buried at St Michael Penkivel.

# Bonaventure Giffard

Giffard died at Hammersmith on 12 March 1733–4, in his ninety-second year, and was buried in the churchyard of Old St. Pancras. 
The tomb disappeared when part of the graveyard was being cleared to enable the expansion of the Midland Railway, but the inscription upon it is printed in ‘Notes and Queries,’ 3rd ser. xii. 191. His name is listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial to the important lost graves in the graveyard.

In 1907 his remains, together with those of his brother Andrew and sister Anne, were re-interred at St Edmund's College, Ware.

Giffard bequeathed his heart to Douay College, and it was buried in the chapel, where a monument with an epitaph in Latin was erected to his memory.

Dodd highly commends Giffard for his charity to the poor, and Granger says he was much esteemed by men of different religions. He procured many large benefactions for the advancement of the catholic religion and the benefit of the clergy, and at his death left about 3,000 shillings for the same ends.

Two of his sermons preached at court were published separately in 1687, and are reprinted in ‘Catholic Sermons,’ 2 vols. Lond. 1741 and 1772. Many interesting letters written by him are printed in the ‘Catholic Miscellany’ for 1826 and 1827. There is a fine picture of him at Chillington, a life size, half length. His portrait has been engraved by Claude du Bosc, from a painting by H. Hysing.

# John Hanbury (1664–1734)

In 1701 he married Albina, daughter of William Selwyn and Albinia daughter of Richard Betenson, and began to enlarge Park House in Pontypool, a property begun by his father in 1659.

In July 1703 he married Bridget, eldest daughter of Sir Edward Ayscough of Stallingborough and South Kelsey. With his marriage to Bridget came a fortune of £10,000 and connections with established political families. Bridget was a close friend of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough and Hanbury was introduced to influential politicians.

They had issue:

Hanbury died in 1734.

# Islam Khan V

Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman in his book Hayat Karam Husain quoted his date of death as 21 Safar 1147 AH/1734 with reference to Tarikh-i Mohammadi while other authors mentioned his death date as 1144 AH/1731–32.

# William Jessop (died 1734)

Jessop died on 8 November 1734. He had a son and four daughters. His son James inherited the title Baron Darcy of Navan from his maternal grandfather but predeceased his father without issue in 1733. Jessop’s daughter Barbara married Andrew Wilkinson, who succeeded to his seat in Parliament.

# Joseph Micklethwaite, 1st Viscount Micklethwaite

Lord Micklethwaite died unmarried in 1734 and his titles became extinct. He left his estate to his mistress, Anne Ewer, the sister of Jane Ewer, wife of the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, from whom it found its way into the Shaftesbury family.

# Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth

Soon after the death of Charles II, Louise quickly fell from favour. She retired to France, where, except for one short visit to England during the reign of James II and her attendance at the Coronation of George I, she remained. Her attendance at George I's coronation was remarked upon by the Countess of Dorchester when they met the Countess of Orkney ("we three whores"). Between them, they had been in turn the maîtresse en titre for successive kings for over 20 years. Her pensions and a grant on the Irish revenue given her by Charles II were lost either in the reign of James II or at the Revolution of 1688.

During her last years, she lived at Aubigny and was harassed by debt. The French king Louis XIV and, after his death, the regent Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, gave her a pension and protected her against her creditors. Louise died in Paris on 14 November 1734, aged 85.

# William Clevland (1664–1734)

He died on 2 June 1734[e] aged 70 and is commemorated by a surviving mural monument erected by his eldest son in Westleigh Church, which is inscribed thus:

Below is a relief sculpted white marble escutcheon showing the arms of Clevland impaling Davie: A ship with two masts or the sails trussed up and twisted to the masts argent adorned with flags charged with the cross of England on a chief of the second three cinquefoils pierced gules. Above is the crest of Clevland: A dexter cubit arm grasping in the hand a sword hilted and pommelled or point to sinister.
