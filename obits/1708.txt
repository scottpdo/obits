# Alexander Edward

Alexander Edward died in Edinburgh, and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The antiquary Robert Sibbald described him as a "great master in architecture, and contrivance of avenues, gardens and orchards".

# Prince George of Denmark

In March and April 1706, George was seriously ill. There was blood in his sputum, but he seemed to recover, although he was too ill to attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral in June for a British victory in the Battle of Ramillies. He missed another thanksgiving service in May 1707, to celebrate the union of England and Scotland, as he was recuperating at Hampton Court.

The Scilly naval disaster of 1707, in which a fleet commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered, highlighted mismanagement at the Admiralty, for which George was nominally responsible. Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with someone more dynamic. By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the Whig Junto—Lords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland—were clamouring for the removal of both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough wrote to his brother telling him to resign, but Churchill refused, protected by Prince George.

Amid the political pressure, George was on his deathbed, suffering from severe asthma and dropsy. He died at 1:30 p.m. on 28 October 1708 at Kensington Palace. The Queen was devastated. James Brydges wrote to General Cadogan,

Anne wrote to her nephew, Frederick IV of Denmark, "the loss of such a husband, who loved me so dearly and so devotedly, is too crushing for me to be able to bear it as I ought." Anne was desperate to stay at Kensington with the body of her husband, but under pressure from the Duchess of Marlborough, she reluctantly left Kensington for St James's Palace. Anne resented the Duchess's intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural "to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead". Anne and the Duchess had been very close, but their friendship had become strained over political differences. The immediate aftermath of George's death damaged their relationship further. He was buried privately at midnight on 13 November in Westminster Abbey.

# Francis Makemie

Makemie and his wife Naomi bought a plantation along Holdens Creek at Temperanceville, Virginia in Accomack County not far from the county seat. There he spent his final years and died in 1708. The community there he helped found still exists.

Circa the 200th anniversary of the Presbyterian Church's founding, outsiders were appalled to find his gravesite on the former plantation in dilapidated condition. They stabilized it and erected a statue and memorial marker. Around that time, the surrounding community was experiencing economic prosperity, and renovated the church he had founded in Accomac, Virginia (named after the founder), as well as bought a disused Methodist church nearby in Onancock, Virginia and after demolishing it to erect a new structure named it after his supportive wife Naomi in 1903. Recently, development pressures in Temperanceville, Virginia led the statue and memorial marker to be moved to behind the Accomac church. [Citation Needed]

# Nicolas Pasquin

Nicolas Paquin died December 16, 1708, at the age of sixty years, probably worn out by work. He had done it its duty of good Christian also working by the sweat of his brow, from dawn until dark, his life during.

Following the death of Nicolas, was son-in-law Marcotte, married in the same year with Marie Paquin, who became his mother-in-law support and the support of the Paquin family, still young. At the death of Nicolas, most children were still at home. So, Marie-Françoise had ended rearing her four minor children, by sharing his home with his daughter Mary and son-in-law Jean-Baptiste Marcotte.

On July 23, 1711 was a great day for the Paquin family since that day it y had a double wedding of the two daughters of Marie-Françoise, or Mary Magdalene and Geneviève. Mary Magdalene was twenty-one years old and she married Jacques Perrault. Geneviève, for its part, was 23 years old and she married Jean-François Naud. The two girls will go to settle at Dennis, Lordship where their husbands already each have a land.

Marie-Françoise had more than two children under his charge, either Marie-Anne and Jean-Baptiste. She could now help Marie, his daughter giving him help with his own daughters. Together Mary and Marie-Françoise raised three daughters of the union of Mary and Jean-Baptiste Marcotte.

In 1720, while she was only sixteen, Marie-Anne married Pierre Groleau, a resident of Deschambault, she had probably met during one of his visits to this Lordship to go see his sisters and his brothers Nicolas, who were already settled there for some time. Jean-Baptiste, the youngest of the family was nineteen years old and worked on the family land. So we can say that Marie had finished to raise all her children, at this time.

Marie-Françoise, widow of Nicolas died on 18 April 1726 and she was buried in the parish of Sainte-Famille on the île d ' Orléans. It had therefore survived him eighteen years. Shortly after the death of his mother, Jean-Baptiste just like his sisters and brother, went to settle in the seigneury of Deschambault. He was married in 1731 with Marguerite Chapelain.

Nicolas Paquin and Marie-Françoise, the strain of this lineage of the Paquins couple, had an eventful life by the various events of everyday life, but otherwise they had a peaceful life.
