# Amedeus Alexander of Savoy

Amedeus Alexander died on 29 April 1755, in Turin, at the age of six months. He was buried in the Basilica of Superga, traditional burial site of the House of Savoy.

# Elizabeth Ashbridge

In Cork, Ireland, Ashbridge fell sick with an unknown illness, attributing her poor health to "bodily hardship in traveling" and "spiritual exercise in mind". After several weeks she proceeded to Waterford, where she again fell ill. She spent three months indisposed at the home of fellow Quaker John Hutchinson. She then continued to Carlow County, where she lodged at the home of Robert Lecky,[who?] and died on May 16, 1755. She was buried three days later at the Ballybrumhill burial ground near Fennagh, County Carlow, Ireland.

# Laurentius Blumentrost

The Duchess of Mecklenburg died on June 14, 1733. The Empress ordered an investigation of Blumentrost; no fault was found on his part, but by 19 June he had been stripped of his positions and income and expelled from St. Petersburg. For a few years he lived in Moscow and had a private medical practice. In 1738, under the patronage of archiater Johann Bernhard Fischer, he became head physician at the Moscow military hospital and director of the hospital school. Empress Anna did not trust Blumentrost, mainly because of his devotion to the two daughters of Peter the Great and Catherine, Anna and Elizabeth. When Elizabeth became Empress, he came back into royal favour. She reinstated his rank of State Councillor and raised his salary. In 1754 he was appointed curator of the newly opened University of Moscow.

Blumentrost died in St. Petersburg on 27 March 1755 of hydrothorax. He is buried at the church of St. Sampson the Hospitable, now Saint Sampson's Cathedral.

Blumentrost's brothers Ivan (Johannes Deodatus or Johann Deodat; 1676–1756) and Christian were also court physicians. Ivan was also personal physician to Peter I (and his field physician and archiater) and had also studied in Halle and Leiden. He fell out of favour under Empress Anna and died in poverty in 1756; he is buried in the same grave with Laurentius.

# Pierluigi Carafa

Pierluigi Cardinal Carafa died on 15 December 1755, at 8:30 p.m. in Rome. His remains were transferred the following day to the church of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte in Rome where the capella paplis took place on 18 December 1755, and he was buried in the chapel of Saint Francis de Sales.

# Christian, Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried-Rheinfels

Christian died of a stroke on 21 October 1755 on the steps of the church in Eschwege.  He was buried in the family crypt in the Hülfensberg.  His widow moved to Frankfurt, where she died on 11 December 1757.

With his death, the Hesse-Wanfried line died out after 88 years.  His territory fell to Hesse-Rotenburg.

# Henry Hall (lighthouse keeper)

In the days following the fire, Hall was able to eat, drink and swallow medicine. He continued to tell Dr. Spry of the lead in his stomach and also told a friend who visited him. Hall seemed to be on the mend but by the sixth day, Dr. Spry observed that Hall's condition was declining. By the tenth and eleventh days, Hall could no longer eat or drink and began to rapidly worsen. He died on Monday, 8 December 1755, aged 94, at his home in East Stonehouse, Plymouth after "being seized with cold sweats and spasms of the tendons, he soon expired".

Dr. Spry conducted an autopsy on Hall noting that, "left side of his body, below the short ribs, in the breast, mouth and throat ... left side of the head and face, with the eye extremely burnt". The autopsy revealed that "the diaphragmatic upper mouth of the stomach greatly inflamed and ulcerated, and the tuncia in the lower part of the stomach burnt; and from the great cavity of it took out a great piece of lead ... which weighed exactly seven ounces, five drachams and eighteen grains". Dr. Spry gave the following written account of how Hall and his two colleagues had explained to him how the lead came to be in Hall's stomach: "It will perhaps be thought difficult to explain the manner, by which the lead entered the stomach: But the account, which the deceased gave me and others, was, that as he was endeavouring to extinguish the flames, which were at a considerable height over his head, the lead of the lanthorn being melted dropped down, before he was aware of it, with great force into his mouth then lifted up and open, and in such a quantity, as to cover not only his face, but all his clothes."

Dr. Spry's account was received with such scepticism by The Royal Society that he felt constrained to conduct experiments on dogs and chickens, pouring melted lead down the animals' throats, to prove that it was possible to survive, for at least a limited period, such an extreme accident. These are the first fully documented and reported British scientific experiments on live animals.[citation needed]

# Iyasu II

Iyasu fell seriously ill in May, 1755, and died the next month.  It was generally believed that he had been poisoned by the sister of Melmal Iyasu, in revenge for her brother's death.   When the Empress Mentewab sought funds from the treasury for his funeral, only a few dinars could be found. Saddened by this situation, she threatened to retire to her palace convent at Qusquam, but a group of nobles persuaded her to instead become regent for her grandson Iyoas I.

# Henry Bromley, 1st Baron Montfort

Through his mother Lord Montfort inherited the manor of Great Malvern in Malvern, Worcestershire, from his ancestor Sir Thomas Bromley and sold it, in about 1740, to Lord Foley. He spent extravagantly  on Horseheath. His gambling, in which he was supposed to be ‘the sharpest genius of his time’, also consumed vast sums of money. He was seriously short of funds by the end of 1754, and applied to Newcastle for some employment. When Newcastle was unable to provide anything it was said he was very reasonable but seemed dejected. On the following morning, 1 January 1755, he wrote his will, and asked his lawyer if it would hold good even if he shot himself. After being told that it would, he went into the next room and blew his brains out. He left debts of £30,000, with an estate out of repair and in a very ruinous condition. He was succeeded in the barony by his only son, Thomas. His daughter, the Honourable Frances, married Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan.

# Suzanne Amomba Paillé

Paillé died on 27 January 1755 in Cayenne and was buried the following day in the Cathédrale of Saint-Sauveur de Cayenne. Upon her death, her assets were combined with those of François de la Mothe Aigron, her former master, to support a school in Cayenne. Some historians believe her donation was coerced, while others have seen the donation as Suzanne Amomba's assertion her own will, taking action before the authorities could thwart her wishes. In 1898, the city of Cayenne asked the Colonial Minister to rename a street in her honor. The street, Rue de Madame Payé was designated and marked the first time Suzanne Amomba was directly associated with her husband's surname.

# Philip François Renault

Philippe François Renault eventually sold his slaves to other settlers and returned to France in 1749, passing his business interests in the Illinois Country on to others. Renault died on April 24, 1755, in France, intestate and without heirs. In the early and late 19th century, attempts by persons claiming to represent the Renault estate to reclaim lands he was granted met with little success.

# Thomas Wilson (bishop)

From his eighty-sixth year, Wilson was burdened with gout. He died at Bishop's Court on 7 March 1755, the fiftieth anniversary of his wife's death. His coffin was made from an elm tree planted by himself, and made into planks for that purpose some years before his death. He had a strong objection, mentioned in his will, to interments within churches, and was buried (11 March) at the east end of Kirk Michael churchyard, where a square marble monument marks his grave. Philip Moore preached the funeral sermon.

# Ulrich Friedrich Woldemar von Löwendal

Marshall Ulrich Friedrich Woldemar Graf von Löwendal died on 27 May 1755 in Paris. He had been married twice (first since 23 January 1722 to Theodora Eugenia von Schmettau, daughter of German General Gottlieb von Schmettau; since 13. November 1736 to Barbe Madeleine Gräfin von Szembek) and was father of eight children.

# Sir William Yonge, 4th Baronet

Yonge died at his seat of Escot, near Honiton, on 10 August 1755. He was succeeded in his title and estates by his eldest son Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet.
