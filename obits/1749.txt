# Adel Shah

In the meantime, Ebrahim Mirza, who had consolidated his hold over western Iran, rose in rebellion against his reigning brother. He murdered Adel's favourite Sohrab Khan and in, June 1748, he marched to join his forces with Amir Aslan Khan, the sardar of Azerbaijan against Adel. The latter, at the head of a numerically superior army, advanced from Gilan to prevent the rebel forces combining, but the defection of many of his commanders precipitated his complete defeat. Adel fled to Tehran, but a local governor surrendered Adel to Ebrahim, who had him blinded. Six months later, Ebrahim was proclaimed shah, but his reign was quickly terminated by a coup which brought Nadir's surviving grandson Shahrokh Mirza to the throne. Ebrahim was blinded and soon died, while Adel was sent in chains to Mashad, where he was tortured to death.

# Charles Coffin (writer)

Coffin died of pneumonia in Paris 20 June 1749. Due to his persistence in appealing against the apostolic constitution Unigenitus, under instructions from the Archbishop, who wished to make an example, the parish rector of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, refused to administer last rites to him, or give him a Christian burial Robert  Darnton observed that, "To deny the final absolution of sins to Christians on their deathbed was, in the eyes of many, to send them straight to Purgatory, an unforgivable abuse of royal and ecclesiastical authority.”  Four thousand Parisians joined the funeral procession. Because the crown had supported the suppression of the Jansenists, Danton notes that the religious rite took on political overtones. The Parlement of Paris subsequently issued an official and strong “remonstrance” to the king. Richard J. Janet sees the resulting popular demonstrations as contributing to the growing disenchantment with the monarchy that would later play into the coming Revolution. 

Coffin left a legacy to the college of Beauvais, and founded awards at the University of Paris.

# Sir John Cope, 6th Baronet

Cope died on 8 December 1749. He had two sons and a daughter. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Sir Monoux Cope, 7th Baronet.

# Matthew Decker

Decker died on 18 March 1749. He  had a son  who died young and three daughters, but only two daughters married:



Catherine (died 1786), who married Richard FitzWilliam, 6th Viscount FitzWilliam, and had issue
Henrietta Anne (died 1747),  who married John Talbot, but had no issue.


He had no surviving  male heir and the baronetcy became extinct. His fortune and estates passed to his surviving daughter Catherine, and then to her son Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam.

# Sir George Downing, 3rd Baronet

Upon his own death, aged 63, in 1749, his title passed to his cousin, Sir Jacob Downing, 4th Baronet, with his will providing that if his line should die out, his fortune and Gamlingay estate should be used to found a college at Cambridge University.  Sir Jacob Downing died childless in 1764, but his widow, Lady Margaret Downing, argued that George Downing's fortune should pass to her. This case was tied up in litigation for decades at considerable expense before the courts finally ordered that the estate should be used to found a college at Cambridge, which occurred with the founding of Downing College, Cambridge in 1800. Lady Margaret then had the Downing mansion demolished in 1776.

# William Fortescue (judge)

Fortescue died on 16 December 1749 aged 63 and was buried in the Rolls Chapel in London, where exists his monument.

# John Sergeant (missionary)

In the summer of 1749, Sergeant fell ill with "a slow or nervous fever, attended with canker, and an inflammation in the throat". He died on July 27, 1749, at age 39, after four weeks of illness. The Stockbridge Native Americans displayed their affection for him by gathering for prayers, and, after his passing, mourning their loss. He left behind his wife, Abigail, and 3 young children. The epitaph on his tombstone was said to be composed by one of the local Native Americans:




Where is that pleasing Form, I ask, thou canst not show;
He's not within, false stone, There's nought but Dust below;
And where's that pious soul, that Thinking conscious MIND?
Wilt thou pretend, vain cypher, THAT'S with thee enshrined?
Alas, my Friend's not here with thee that I can find;
Here's not a Sergeant's body or a Sergeant's MIND.
I'll seek him hence, for all's alike Deception here.
I'll go to Heav'n & I shall find my Sergeant there.




Stockbridge went without a resident minister for over two years, with the schoolmaster, Timothy Woodbridge, overseeing the mission. During this time, a feud for control of the town started, between the Woodbridge and the Williams factions. Sergeant was eventually succeeded by the Reverend Jonathan Edwards, who was endorsed by the Woodbridges.

# Baron Franz von der Trenck

After a time he was brought before a court-martial in Vienna, which convicted him of having sold and withdrawn commissions to his officers without the permission of the empress, having punished his men without heed of the military code, and having drawn pay and allowance for fictitious men. Much was allowed to an irregular officer in all these respects, but Trenck had far outrun the admitted limits, and above all his brutalities and robberies had made him detested throughout Austria and Silesia. A death sentence followed, but the composition of the court-martial and its proceedings were thought to have been such as from the first forbade a fair trial as such, though most modern historians think the sentence to have been correct, even so. Nonetheless, concerns about the apparently arbitrary form of the proceedings meant that eventually the sentence was commuted by the Empress into one of cashiering and imprisonment. The rest of his life was spent in mild captivity in the fortress of Spielberg (Czech: Špilberk) in Brno, where he died on October 4, 1749.  
In his last will he left the sum of 30,000 gulden to the small town of Marienburg which had been sacked, burned and razed to the ground by his troops.

Trenck's mummified remains can presently be seen on display in the crypt of Brno's Capuchin Monastery.
