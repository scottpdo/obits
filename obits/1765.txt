# James Carnegie of Finhaven

On 9 May 1728 Mr Carnegie of Lour, residing in the burgh of Forfar, was burying his daughter. Before the funeral, he entertained the Earl of Strathmore, his own brother James Carnegie of Finhaven, Mr Lyon of Bridgeton, and some others, at dinner in his house. After the funeral, these gentlemen adjourned to a tavern, and drank a good deal. Carnegie of Finhaven got extremely drunk. Lyon of Bridgeton was not so intoxicated, but the drink made him "rude and unmannerly" towards Finhaven. Afterwards, the Earl of Strathmore went to call at the house of Mr Carnegie’s sister, Lady Auchterhouse (a distant relative of the Earl) and the others followed.

This group, like a large proportion of the Forfarshire gentry of the time supported the Jacobites: and the 6th earl’s late brother (the 5th Earl) had fallen at the battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715 fighting for the Old Pretender, as had Patrick Lyon of Auchterhouse, the husband of the lady they were visiting. Bridgeton did not conduct himself as appropriate in the presence of the lady and he even had the audacity to pinch his hostess's arms. Bridgeton was very rude to Finhaven and spoke of: "his not being willing to marry one of his daughters to Lord Rosehill, about his having no sons, about his debts ... and he even used some rudeness towards the lady herself."

It was with the utmost difficulty that Lord Strathmore induced his two companions to leave the house. About dusk, the party sallied forth into the street, and "now that the modified restraint of a lady's presence was removed," Bridgeton pushed Carnegie of Finhaven into a "deep and dirty kennel" (ditch) which ran along the roadside. Carnegie emerged covered nearly head to foot with mud and furious. "Such an insult could only be wiped out with blood." So Carnegie of Finhaven, rose and drawing his sword, ran up to Bridgeton, with deadly design. The earl, seeing him advance, imprudently threw himself between the two antagonists with the intention of diverting the blow and unhappily received the lunge full in the middle of his own body, the sword passing right through the Earl. The Earl died forty-nine hours after the incident.

# Alexis Clairaut

Clairaut was unmarried, and known for leading an active social life. His growing popularity in society hindered his scientific work: "He was focused," says Bossut, "with dining and with evenings, coupled with a lively taste for women, and seeking to make his pleasures into his day to day work, he lost rest, health, and finally life at the age of fifty-two." Though he led a fulfilling social life, he was very prominent in the advancement of learning in young mathematicians.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 27 October 1737.

Clairaut died in Paris in 1765.

# Prokop Diviš

Diviš died on 21 December 1765 in Přímětice.

After years of obscurity, memory of Diviš was reignited in the late 19th century. Now seen as a visionary inventor, supporters saw him as the European inventor of the lightning rod, who invented the lightning rod in the same years as Benjamin Franklin, probably even independently. Despite scientific reviews of Diviš's errors (among others, German physicist Meidinger, who compared evidence about early lightning rods in 1888; and Czech scientific historians Smolka and Haubelt in 2004/05), there are still popular claims that Prokop Diviš invented the lightning rod. Indeed, his free-standing apparatus in 1754 was probably better grounded than Franklin's experimental lightning rods at that time. The "weather-machine" failed, however, the common purpose of lightning rods: to actually protect a building; while the grounding chains were not remotely secure.

# Sarah Dixon

Sarah Dixon died on 23 April 1765 at the age of 93, according to the St Austin's memorial stone, at the village of Hackington.

# Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz

In the summer of 1765, he moved to one of his castles in Miroslavské Knínice, where, due to dysentery, his health worsened. He died on 30 August 1765. His body was taken to Náměšť nad Oslavou, where he was buried on 1 September 1765 in the crypt of the Church of St. John the Baptist. Later, his remains, along with those of his wife, were moved, on 19 February 1768, to a crypt in the Capuchin church near the castle in Náměšť.

# Louis, Dauphin of France (son of Louis XV)

Kept away from government affairs by his father, Louis was at the center of the Dévots, a group of religiously-minded men who hoped to gain power when he succeeded to the throne.

Louis died of tuberculosis at Fontainebleau in 1765 at the age of 36, while his father was still alive, so he never became king of France. His mother, Queen Marie Leszczyńska, and his maternal grandfather, the former king of Poland, Stanisław I Leszczyński, Duke of Lorraine, also survived him.  His eldest surviving son, Louis-Auguste, duc de Berry, became the new dauphin, ascending the throne as Louis XVI at the death of Louis XV, in May 1774.

Louis was buried in the Cathedral of Saint-Étienne in Sens.  His heart was buried at Saint Denis Basilica.

# Herbert Mackworth

Mackworth died on 20 August 1765, leaving a son and six daughters. His son, also Herbert, followed him as MP for Cardiff and was created a baronet in 1776. His daughter Susanna married Sir John Hotham, 9th Baronet, Bishop of Clogher.

# Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel

Marie Louise died on 9 April 1765 in Leeuwarden, the capital city of the Dutch province of Friesland. She outlived her son William by 14 years.

# Barbara Montagu

Montagu died in August 1765 and was buried in the Church of St Mary, Charlcombe. Per instructions in her will, she returned the £100 annuity her brother had given her in her lifetime. She left over £1,000 to two of her sisters, various members of their community, servants, students she was assisting with education, with the bulk of her estate going to Scott, outright—stating that should Scott remarry, the monies could not come under the control of a spouse. Scott lived for thirty years after the death of Montagu, benefiting from her largess and adhering to the charitable principles they had established together.

# Prince Paata of Kartli

In 1765, Paata's Tbilisi apartment—rented from the certain Markozashvili—became a meeting ground for the nobles of Kartli disaffected with Heraclius II. The resulting plot to assassinate the king and place Paata on the throne was formed under varying circumstances: the Mukhranian royals, as well as their legitimist supporters, could not reconcile themselves with the establishment of their Kakhetian cousins, in the person of Heraclius II, on the throne of Kartli. Furthermore, the leading noble families, such as the Tsitsishvili and Amilakhvari, resented Heraclius's decision to settle former Georgian slaves liberated from foreign captivity as freemen on royal land, rather than returning these peasants as serfs to their former landlords. Prince Dimitri Amilakhvari, one of the principal ringleaders, also had a personal reason to hate his sovereign: he felt himself insulted in the person of his son, Giorgi, whose marriage to Heraclius's sister, Princess Elisabed, had been disrupted by the king.

Datuna, an artisan from Samshvilde and the husband of a royal nursemaid, who was to guide the conspirators into the king's palace, admitted to being part of the plot in a confession to a priest, who immediately informed Heraclius. The king had the conspirators rounded up and tried in public by a court appointed of the aristocracy as well as peasants. Heraclius testified himself, leaving verdicts and sentences to the court. Twenty-two persons, reportedly including the polyglot poet Sayat Nova, were acquitted. The leaders were punished with death or mutilation. Among them, Paata and his cousin, David, son of Abdullah Beg, were beheaded, David's father-in-law, Prince Elizbar Taktakishvili, was burned to death, Dimitri Amilakhvari was dispossessed of all of his titles and properties and his son, Aleksandre, had his nose cut off, Prince Glakha Tsitsishvili lost his tongue, others lost their sight.

# Charles Parkin

Parkin died on 27 August 1765, and by his will (dated 17 June 1759) bequeathed money to his old college for the foundation of exhibitions to be held by scholars from the  Merchant Taylors' School and from the free school at Bowes, Yorkshire, which had been founded by his uncle, William Hutchinson of Clement's Inn.

# Hugh Willoughby, 15th Baron Willoughby of Parham

Hugh Willoughby died without issue on 22 January 1765 in London. Though a prominent dissenter, he was buried in the chancel of Horwich Church on 9 February 1765. He left his distant cousin, Henry Willoughby, heir to the barony, and property in Rivington and Anglezarke to his sisters, Helen Roscoe and Elizabeth Shaw. In memory of the family there is a monument at Rivington Unitarian Chapel. The Willoughby pew, bearing its original brass name plate on the south wall of the chapel has been preserved and is noted for its large ornate canopy with  panelled reredos and a moulded and carved cornice in the classical style.
