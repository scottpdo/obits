# Denis Bond (MP)

Bond died on 30 January 1747. He had married Leonara Sophia Dummer, widow of Edmund Dummer and daughter of the diplomat Sir William Dutton Colt in 1729.  They had no children and Bond's estates, including Creech Grange, passed to his nephew John Bond.

# David Brainerd

In November 1746, he became too ill to continue ministering, and so moved to Jonathan Dickinson's house in Elizabethtown. After a few months of rest, he travelled to Northampton, Massachusetts, where he stayed at the house of Jonathan Edwards. Apart from a trip to Boston in the summer of that year, he remained at Edwards's house until his death the following year. In May 1747, he was diagnosed with incurable consumption; in these final months, he suffered greatly. In his diary entry for 24 September, Brainerd wrote:

During this time, he was nursed by Jerusha Edwards, Jonathan's seventeen-year-old daughter. The friendship that grew between them was of a kind that has led some to suggest they were romantically attached. He died from tuberculosis on 9 October 1747, at the age of 29. He is buried at Bridge Street Cemetery in Northampton, next to Jerusha, who died in February 1748 as a result of contracting tuberculosis from nursing Brainerd. His gravestone reads:

# George FitzRoy, Earl of Euston

FitzRoy died without issue on 7 July 1747.

# Charles Fleetwood (theatre manager)

After the sale of the Drury Lane theatre patent, Fleetwood moved to the Chalon-sur-Saône area in France sometime in the spring of 1745. He died there, seemingly insolvent, in August 1747.

# Edward Foley (1676–1747)

Foley died unmarried on 4 April 1747 from an infection in his foot. His estate passed to his nephew, the 2nd Lord Foley.

# Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen

He died in 1747 or 1748 in Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey and was buried at Elm Ridge Cemetery, North Brunswick, New Jersey. He was originally buried without a tombstone.  When in 1884 his descendants decided to place a stone on his grave, they could not determine where his body was interred. A cenotaph was placed in the front of the cemetery, which now is the back of the cemetery at the treeline.

# Lord George Graham

Graham appears to have been taken ill during his time at sea, and he went ashore at Bristol. His brother, William Graham, 2nd Duke of Montrose came to meet him there in October, but Lord George Graham's health declined further, and he died at Bath on 2 January 1747. John Charnock concluded his biography of Graham with the observation that "from a multitude of concurrent testimonies he appears to have been an officer that attained a great share of popularity, and was indeed, very deservedly, the idol of all seamen who knew him, as well on the account of the high opinion entertained of his gallantry, of an invincible fund of good humour, which latter quality conciliated the affections of men in the same degree that the first related excited their admiration and esteem." His group portrait by Hogarth survived him, and is now held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum.

# Sir James Grant, 6th Baronet

Grant died on 16 January 1747. He and his wife had six sons and eight daughters. His eldest son Ludovick was a commissioner of police and succeeded to the baronetcy.  His second son was a captain in the army. His fourth, and third, surviving son was Lieutenant-General Francis Grant (1717-1781)

# Thomas Grenville (Royal Navy officer)

Grenville was moved to the 60-gun HMS Defiance in 1746, and was elected as MP for the naval town of Bridport on 12 December 1746. He was ordered on an independent cruise in early 1747, due of the influence of his brother George, who was at this time one of the lords of the admiralty, but at the last moment his orders were changed and Grenville was ordered to join the fleet under George Anson. The change in orders caused annoyance, though Anson wrote to George Grenville to promise that he would detach Thomas as soon as he was able.

On 3 May, Anson came across a French squadron, under the command of the Marquis de la Jonquière, off Cape Finisterre and attacked them. In the Battle of Cape Finisterre, Anson won a decisive victory, but Grenville was among the casualties. He had been hit by a large splinter two hours into the engagement, which smashed his left thigh. The leg was at once amputated, but Grenville succumbed to his wounds five hours later. His body was returned to England, where George Lyttelton wrote that the joy of the victory "is palled to our family by the loss of poor Captain Grenville, one of the most promising young men in the navy, and who, had he lived, would have been an honour not to his family only, but to his country." Thomas Grenville was buried at the family seat in Wotton Underwood. His uncle, Lord Cobham, raised a column to his memory in the grounds of his house at Stowe.

# Joshua Guest

In his will, dated 22 May 1746, and proved 26 October 1747, his wife Sarah is the only person mentioned. She died 17 July 1751, and is buried in the abbey near her husband. By her will she left lands and tenements to her husband's connections the Smiths, and considerable legacies to her own relatives of the names of Leigh, Blacklidge, and Winstanley. Guest's niece married Captain Leonard Smelt.

# William Levinz (MP)

# Noor Mohammad Kalhoro

It was about this time, on the 12th of Saffar of the same year 1168 AH (1755 AD) that the ruler of Sind Mián Núr Muhammad died of quinsy or the inflammation of the throat in the vicinity of Jesalmer.

The nobles of the state lost no time in electing the late ruler's eldest son Muhammad Murádyáb Khán to the throne. That young nobleman, fearing lest he might be again given away as a hostage, had left his father on the way and betaken himself in a different direction, from which he had to be brought to fill the vacant throne. This ceremony of enthronement took place on 16th, i.e. 4 days after the late Mián's death.

# Nader Shah

Nader became increasingly cruel as a result of his illness and his desire to extort more and more tax money to pay for his military campaigns. New revolts broke out and Nader crushed them ruthlessly, building towers from his victims' skulls in imitation of his hero Timur. In 1747, Nader set off for Khorasan, where he intended to punish Kurdish rebels.  Some of his officers and courtiers feared he was about to execute them and plotted against him, including two of his relatives: Muhammad Quli Khan, the captain of the guards, and Salah Khan, the overseer of Nader's household. Nader Shah was assassinated on 20 June 1747, at Quchan in Khorasan. He was surprised in his sleep by around fifteen conspirators, and stabbed to death. Nader was able to kill two of the assassins before he died.


The most detailed account of Nader's assassination comes from Père Louis Bazin, Nader's physician at the time of his death, who relied on the eyewitness testimony of Chuki, one of Nader's favourite concubines:
After his death, he was succeeded by his nephew Ali Qoli, who renamed himself Adil Shah ("righteous king"). Adil Shah was probably involved in the assassination plot. Adil Shah was deposed within a year. During the struggle between Adil Shah, his brother Ibrahim Khan and Nader's grandson Shah Rukh and almost all provincial governors declared independence, established their own states, and the entire Empire of Nader Shah fell into anarchy. Oman and the Uzbek khanates of Bukhara and Khiva regained independence, while the Ottoman Empire regained the lost territories in Western Armenia and Mesopotamia. Finally, Karim Khan founded the Zand dynasty and became ruler of Iran by 1760. Erekle II and Teimuraz II, who, in 1744, had been made the kings of Kakheti and Kartli respectively by Nader himself for their loyal service, capitalized on the eruption of instability, and declared de facto independence. Erekle II assumed control over Kartli after Teimuraz II's death, thus unifying the two as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler in three centuries to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia, and due to the frantic turn of events in mainland Iran he would be able to maintain its autonomy until the advent of the Iranian Qajar dynasty. The rest of the Iranian territories in the Caucasus, comprising modern-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Dagestan broke away into various khanates. Until the advent of the Zands and Qajars, its rulers had various forms of autonomy, but stayed vassals and subjects to the Iranian king. In the far east, Ahmad Shah Durrani had already proclaimed independence, marking the foundation of modern Afghanistan. Iran finally lost Bahrain to House of Khalifa during Invasion of Bani Utbah in 1783.

Nader Shah was well known to the European public of the time. In 1768, Christian VII of Denmark commissioned Sir William Jones to translate a Persian language biography of Nader Shah written by his Minister Mirza Mehdi Khan Astarabadi into French. It was published in 1770 as Histoire de Nadir Chah. Nader's Indian campaign alerted the British East India Company to the extreme weakness of the Mughal Empire and the possibility of expanding to fill the power vacuum. Without Nader, "eventual British [in India] would have come later and in a different form, perhaps never at all - with important global effects".

# Catherine Opalińska

When his mother-in-law, the spouse of the dethroned king of Poland, died in 1747, Louis XV ordered a commemorative ceremony, in her honour at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The ceremony glorified the deceased who underwent a veritable deification.

Her tomb is in the church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, in Nancy, next to her husband and the heart of their daughter.

# John Drummond, 4th Duke of Perth

Drummond died at the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom on 28 September 1747 after falling sick with a fever. He had been Brigadier in command of the picquets in the trenches; shortly before his death he was promoted to the rank of Major-General. He was buried in the chapel of the English convent at Antwerp; the convent buildings were sold in the 1790s and a search in 1844 found his memorial had been lost.

# Amaro Pargo

Amaro died 14 October 1747 in his hometown. According to chronicles, his funeral was "very solemn" and during the funeral procession transferring his body to his burial site eight stops were made on the street, slowed down by the crowd that accompanied the procession.

He was buried in the Santo Domingo de Guzmán Convent in La Laguna, in a family tomb.

In the marble headstone is engraved the family shield, and under it a skull winking his right eye with two crossbones. At his death his estate was substantial, and the natural son Manuel de la Trinidad Amaro appeared in La Laguna demanding his part, but the rest of his heirs rejected his claims.

# Thomas Rose (died 1747)

He died on 9 January 1747, aged 68. "A stone of eight ounces and one dram was found in his kidneys". His mural monument survives in Broadhembury Church, Devon, erected by his daughter Mrs Drewe. It displays at top the canting arms of Rose: Sable, on a pale or three roses gules slipt and leaved proper; Crest at top: A rose slipped and leaved; bottom: Drewe (Ermine, a lion passant gules) impaling Rose. It is inscribed as follows:
