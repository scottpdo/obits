# Denis Bond (MP)

Bond died on 30 January 1747. He had married Leonara Sophia Dummer, widow of Edmund Dummer and daughter of the diplomat Sir William Dutton Colt in 1729.  They had no children and Bond's estates, including Creech Grange, passed to his nephew John Bond.

# David Brainerd

In November 1746, he became too ill to continue ministering, and so moved to Jonathan Dickinson's house in Elizabethtown. After a few months of rest, he travelled to Northampton, Massachusetts, where he stayed at the house of Jonathan Edwards. Apart from a trip to Boston in the summer of that year, he remained at Edwards's house until his death the following year. In May 1747, he was diagnosed with incurable consumption; in these final months, he suffered greatly. In his diary entry for 24 September, Brainerd wrote:




'In the greatest distress that ever I endured having an uncommon kind of hiccough; which either strangled me or threw me into a straining to vomit'.




During this time, he was nursed by Jerusha Edwards, Jonathan's seventeen-year-old daughter. The friendship that grew between them was of a kind that has led some to suggest they were romantically attached. He died from tuberculosis on 9 October 1747, at the age of 29. He is buried at Bridge Street Cemetery in Northampton, next to Jerusha, who died in February 1748 as a result of contracting tuberculosis from nursing Brainerd. His gravestone reads:




Sacred to the memory of the Rev. David Brainerd. A faithful and laborious missionary to the Stockbridge, Delaware and Sasquehanna TRIBES OF INDIANS WHO died in this town. October 10, 1747 AE 32.

# George FitzRoy, Earl of Euston

FitzRoy died without issue on 7 July 1747.

# Charles Fleetwood (theatre manager)

After the sale of the Drury Lane theatre patent, Fleetwood moved to the Chalon-sur-Saône area in France sometime in the spring of 1745. He died there, seemingly insolvent, in August 1747.

# Edward Foley (1676–1747)

Foley died unmarried on 4 April 1747 from an infection in his foot. His estate passed to his nephew, the 2nd Lord Foley.

# Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen

He died in 1747 or 1748 in Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey and was buried at Elm Ridge Cemetery, North Brunswick, New Jersey. He was originally buried without a tombstone.  When in 1884 his descendants decided to place a stone on his grave, they could not determine where his body was interred. A cenotaph was placed in the front of the cemetery, which now is the back of the cemetery at the treeline.




Rev. Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen. Born at Lingen, East Freesland in 1691. In 1719, he was sent to take charge of the Reformed Churches here by the Classis of Amsterdam. He was a learned man and a successful preacher. The field of his labor still bears fruit. In contending for a Spiritual Religion his motto was, "Laudem non quaero, culpam non timeo." He died in 1747, and his descendants, humbly sharing in his faith, have erected to his memory this monument.

# Lord George Graham

Graham appears to have been taken ill during his time at sea, and he went ashore at Bristol. His brother, William Graham, 2nd Duke of Montrose came to meet him there in October, but Lord George Graham's health declined further, and he died at Bath on 2 January 1747. John Charnock concluded his biography of Graham with the observation that "from a multitude of concurrent testimonies he appears to have been an officer that attained a great share of popularity, and was indeed, very deservedly, the idol of all seamen who knew him, as well on the account of the high opinion entertained of his gallantry, of an invincible fund of good humour, which latter quality conciliated the affections of men in the same degree that the first related excited their admiration and esteem." His group portrait by Hogarth survived him, and is now held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum.

# Sir James Grant, 6th Baronet

Grant died on 16 January 1747. He and his wife had six sons and eight daughters. His eldest son Ludovick was a commissioner of police and succeeded to the baronetcy.  His second son was a captain in the army. His fourth, and third, surviving son was Lieutenant-General Francis Grant (1717-1781)

# Thomas Grenville (Royal Navy officer)

  Column erected to Grenville's memory at Stowe House, by his uncle, Lord Cobham


Grenville was moved to the 60-gun HMS Defiance in 1746, and was elected as MP for the naval town of Bridport on 12 December 1746. He was ordered on an independent cruise in early 1747, due of the influence of his brother George, who was at this time one of the lords of the admiralty, but at the last moment his orders were changed and Grenville was ordered to join the fleet under George Anson. The change in orders caused annoyance, though Anson wrote to George Grenville to promise that he would detach Thomas as soon as he was able.

On 3 May, Anson came across a French squadron, under the command of the Marquis de la Jonquière, off Cape Finisterre and attacked them. In the Battle of Cape Finisterre, Anson won a decisive victory, but Grenville was among the casualties. He had been hit by a large splinter two hours into the engagement, which smashed his left thigh. The leg was at once amputated, but Grenville succumbed to his wounds five hours later. His body was returned to England, where George Lyttelton wrote that the joy of the victory "is palled to our family by the loss of poor Captain Grenville, one of the most promising young men in the navy, and who, had he lived, would have been an honour not to his family only, but to his country." Thomas Grenville was buried at the family seat in Wotton Underwood. His uncle, Lord Cobham, raised a column to his memory in the grounds of his house at Stowe.

# Joshua Guest

Guest died at his lodgings, Brook Street, London, 14 October 1747, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a monument was erected to him by his widow. In his will, dated 22 May 1746, and proved 26 October 1747, his wife Sarah is the only person mentioned. She died 17 July 1751, and is buried in the abbey near her husband. By her will she left lands and tenements to her husband's connections the Smiths, and considerable legacies to her own relatives of the names of Leigh, Blacklidge, and Winstanley. Guest's niece married Captain Leonard Smelt.
