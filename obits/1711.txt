# Prince Alexander of Imereti (1674–1711)

During the plague outbreak, Alexander was evacuated to Örebro in October 1710. In connection with the 1710 prisoner exchange, Alexander was finally released and allowed to return home. In December 1710, he set off on a journey, through Gävle and Umeå, around the Gulf of Bothnia. By that time, the prince's health had severely deteriorated, but he turned down all suggestions that he rest. He died on 3 February 1711 in Piteå, of kidney stones or kidney failure. His remains were transported to Villnäs (Askainen) and reburied to the Donskoy Monastery near Moscow in March 1712. The bilingual Georgian-Swedish memorial plaque currently displayed on the Treasurer's House in Stockholm erroneously indicates that he lived there the entire time he was in Sweden from 1701 to 1710. Further, the plaque also mistakenly states that he was exchanged for the Swedish count Carl Piper. 

According to Voltaire, Charles XII had himself commented on the Georgian prince's vicissitudes: "It is, said he, as if I were one day to be a prisoner among the Crimean Tatars", the words that would prove prophetic—an allusion to Charles's enforced residence in the Ottoman territory after his defeat at the Battle of Poltava in 1709. 

Prince Alexander is a purported translator of The Testament of Basil the Macedonian into Georgian.

# William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath

Lord Bath died of smallpox in May 1711, aged 19, when the earldom became extinct.

# Charles, Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried

Charles died in 1711 and was succeeded as Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried by his son William II.  After William's death in 1731, he was succeeded by his half-brother Christian, who died childless in 1755, thereby ending the Hessen-Wanfried line.

# Henry Darnall

Darnall died in 1711, stripped of his numerous offices but nonetheless extremely wealthy, having accumulated 30,000 acres (120 km2) of land.

A small portion of Darnall's former property, now called Darnall's Chance, can still be visited today. The house sits on several acres of a formerly large tract of land of thousands of acres patented in 1704 by Darnall. This plot was sold in 1741 by Darnalls' granddaughter Eleanor Darnall Carroll and her husband to James Wardrop, a merchant.  He built the house ca. 1742.  It was restored to its mid-eighteenth century state to reflect the life of Lettice Lee, who lived there for 30 years.

Darnall's stepson, Thomas Brooke, Jr. would become Governor of Maryland in 1720, under the new Calvert Proprietorship, restored by the King in 1715.

# Charles Duncombe (English banker)

Duncombe died unmarried  at Teddington on 9 April 1711, and was described as ‘the richest commoner of England’. His brother, Anthony Duncombe, was also MP for Hedon, died before him. His nephew and heir, also called Anthony, was later ennobled as Lord Feversham. His sister Ursula Duncombe inherited half of Duncombe's fortune and was the ancestor of the present-day Barons Feversham.

# Francisca del Espíritu Santo Fuentes

Francisca del Espíritu Santo Fuentes died at 3:00 p.m. of August 24, 1711. She was buried at the gospel side of the chapel of Colegio de San Juan de Letran. She left behind the Beaterio de Santa Catalina de Siena (Sta. Catalina College) which still stands to this day as the Congregation of the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena.

# Giovanni Maria Gabrielli

He died on September 17, 1711, at the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, near Viterbo. According to his will, his corpse was buried in the church of San Bernardo alle Terme, his internal organs in that of Santa Pudenziana and his heart in the beloved basilica of San Sebastiano fuori le mura. Three tombstones were erected in each of the churches and a marble bust was placed in San Sebastiano, to whose monks he had bequeathed his estate.

# Qazi Ghulam Mustafa

He died on 20 Muharram 1129 AH/1716 and buried in Ferozepur Jhirka. In another book, his date of death is mentioned as last days of dhul Hijjah 1122 AH / 1710 AD. However, an epitaph from Ferozepur Jhirka, places the death of Kartalab Khan Bahadur, son of Shaikh Muhammad Asaf in AH 1123 (AD 1711)

# Anthony Henley (1667–1711)

Henley died of apoplexy in August 1711.

# Edward Hungerford (spendthrift)

In his old age Hungerford is stated to have become a poor knight of Windsor. He died in 1711 and was buried in the church of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. With the death of Sir Edward, the notable history of the family of Hungerford of Farleigh practically closes.

# Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey

He died on 25 August 1711 of apoplexy.

# John William Friso, Prince of Orange

On coming of age in 1707, John William Friso became a general of the Dutch troops during the War of Spanish Succession, under the command of the Duke of Marlborough, and turned out to be a competent officer. He commanded Dutch infantry in the battle of Oudenarde, siege of Lille, and battle of Malplaquet. The prestige that he acquired from his military service should have favored his eventual elevation as stadtholder in the remaining five provinces. However, in 1711, when traveling from the front in Flanders to meet the King of Prussia in The Hague in connection with his suit in the succession dispute, he drowned on 14 July when the ferry boat on the Moerdyk was overturned in heavy weather. His son was born six weeks after his death.

# Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor

During the smallpox epidemic of 1711, which killed Louis, le Grand Dauphin and three siblings of the future Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, Joseph became infected. He died on 17 April in the Hofburg Palace. He had previously promised his wife to stop having affairs, should he survive.

The Emperor was buried in the Imperial Crypt, resting place of the majority of the Habsburgs. His funeral took place on 20 April, in tomb no. 35 in Karl's Vault. His tomb was designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, decorated with pictures of various battles from the War of Spanish Succession. Josefstadt (the eighth district of Vienna) is named for Joseph.

# Eusebio Kino

Kino remained among his missions until his death in 1711. He died from fever on 15 March 1711, aged 65, in what is present-day Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, Mexico. His skeletal remains can be viewed in his crypt which is a national monument of Mexico.

# William Fermor, 1st Baron Leominster

Fermor died on 7 December 1711, and was succeeded by his only son, Thomas Fermor, who was created Earl of Pomfret (i.e. Pontefract, Yorkshire) on 27 December 1721.

# Richard Levett

Sir Richard Levett died in 1711. He and his wife and several of their daughters are buried in the churchyard at Kew, where there are memorials to them in the church as well as to the Blackborne family with whom they intermarried. The inscription carved into a mural slab set in the tower of Saint Anne's Church, Kew, reads: "Within this vault lie the remains of Sir Richard Levett, Knight, of Kew. Also of Lady Mary Levett, his wife, who died October 15th, 1722."

Sir Richard Levett's son Richard, also an Alderman (1722) and Sheriff of London, inherited his father's interests, but apparently mismanaged them, filing for bankruptcy in 1730. Consequently, many heirlooms of the Levett family of Sussex passed to the family of the Lord Mayor's daughter and her husband, the Hulse family of Hampshire, and are today at Breamore House, the Hulse family seat. (Alderman Levett, son of the Lord Mayor, died and was buried in Temple Church in 1740).

The third brother of Richard and Francis Levett was Rev. Dr. William Levett, principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and Dean of Bristol. The brothers' uncle, brother of their father Rev. Richard Levett of Rutland, was courtier William Levett Esq., who accompanied King Charles I during his flight from Cromwellian forces, and thence to his imprisonment at Carisbrooke Castle and to his eventual execution.

Some twelve years following Sir Richard's death, his wife Mary, by then living at Bath, changed her will to exclude two paintings she had previously bequeathed to a friend at Bath upon discovering that the portraits of King Charles I and his Queen were painted by the artist Anthony van Dyck. Given the discovery, Dame Mary Levett made a codicil to her will directing that the valuable paintings be sold with the proceeds going to her granddaughters. Presumably the Levett family had inherited the paintings from the Lord Mayor's uncle, groom of the bedchamber to the late King.

# Anne Long

In late 1711, by careful management of her £100 annuity and £60 rental from 'Newburg-house' in London, (Swift, Journal to Stella, 2.446) having almost paid her debts, Anne hoped to be able to leave King's Lynn. However, she had for some time suffered from asthma and dropsy, and she died in King's Lynn on 22 December. When Swift arrived in London at the Vanhomrighs' house on 25 December, for Christmas dinner, he was told the news: 'I never was more afflicted at any death – She had all sorts of amiable qualities, and no ill ones but the indiscretion of neglecting her own affairs' (ibid., 2.445–6). Swift suspected that to avoid the expense of a London funeral or public mourning, Anne's brother intended to keep her death a secret. Swift placed a notice of her death in The Post-Boy of 27 December. He also wrote to Thomas Pyle, the minister of St Nicholas's Chapel, at King's Lynn, revealing Anne's true identity and asking that she be buried in the church and that a memorial stone be placed there at Swift's own expense. Swift wrote in his account book a private commemoration of Anne Long, which was perhaps his most eloquent appreciation of her: 'She was the most beautiful Person of the Age she lived in, of great Honr and Virtue, infinite Sweetness and Generosity of Temper and true good Sense'.
She figures in "The British Court", a poem published in 1707.

# John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle

The duke died in 1711 from injuries received in a fall from his horse while hunting near Welbeck.He left his Cavendish estates to his son-in-law,  Edward Harley (later 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer) and the remainder of his property to his nephew Thomas Pelham, subsequently 1st Duke of Newcastle (third creation) and prime minister.

# Oliver Le Neve


Oliver Le Neve died on 23 November 1711 at West Harling, and was buried with his first wife Anne Gawdy at Great Witchingham. As his sons predeceased him, his estate passed to his elder brother Peter until his death in 1729, who in his will intended the estate to pass to his three nieces, Le Neve's daughters. However, after legal battles, with accusations by the Le Neves of conflict interest, the estate was taken through reversion of the will by the trustees of a John Norris, whose grandfather, a Norwich lawyer of the same name, had acted as trustee for the young Oliver Le Neve. The three daughters of Le Neve were ejected from the estate. These three surviving daughters by Anne Gawdy—Isabella, Anne and Henrietta—inherited the Gawdy estate at West Harling, and erected a chancel marble wall monument to their parents in St Mary's Church at Great Witchingham. The monument inscription reads:

# Saif bin Sultan

Saif bin Sultan died on 4 October 1711. He was buried in the castle of Rustaq in a handsome tomb, later destroyed by a Wahhabi general.
At his death he had great wealth, said to include 28 ships, 700 male slaves and one third of Oman's date trees. He was succeeded by his son Sultan bin Saif II.
Saif bin Sultan earned the title "the Earth's bond" or "the chain of the Earth" for the benefits he had brought to the people of Oman.
According to Samuel Barrett Miles,

# Joseph Vaz

King Vimaldharna Surya II, Vaz's patron, died in 1707, but Vira Narendra Sinha, his successor, proved to be an even greater supporter. New missionaries arrived in 1708. In 1710, despite health problems, Vaz took another apostolic trip. On his return, he fell ill. He recovered from a series of infections and fevers, but was left weakened. He undertook eight days of spiritual exercises prescribed by the Oratorian Rule, but before the seventh day he died at Kandy on 16 January 1711, aged 59.

Vaz's work was carried forward by Jacome Gonsalves.

# Francis Wainwright

Wainwright was about to be remarried to Eliza Hirst of Salem, when he suddenly became sick and died. The wedding was set to take place on July 31, 1711; he becoming sick on the 29th, and dying on the 3rd in his house, at ten in the morning: his bride-to-be staying by his side to the end. The Colonel left a considerable amount of money to his son Francis, who also inherited through his mother, a niece of Rev.John Norton, lands in Ipswich.
