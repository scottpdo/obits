# Prince Alexander of Imereti (1674–1711)

  A plaque in Stockholm commemorating Prince Alexander.
 

During the plague outbreak, Alexander was evacuated to Örebro in October 1710. In connection with the 1710 prisoner exchange, Alexander was finally released and allowed to return home. In December 1710, he set off on a journey, through Gävle and Umeå, around the Gulf of Bothnia. By that time, the prince's health had severely deteriorated, but he turned down all suggestions that he rest. He died on 3 February 1711 in Piteå, of kidney stones or kidney failure. His remains were transported to Villnäs (Askainen) and reburied to the Donskoy Monastery near Moscow in March 1712. The bilingual Georgian-Swedish memorial plaque currently displayed on the Treasurer's House in Stockholm erroneously indicates that he lived there the entire time he was in Sweden from 1701 to 1710. Further, the plaque also mistakenly states that he was exchanged for the Swedish count Carl Piper. 

According to Voltaire, Charles XII had himself commented on the Georgian prince's vicissitudes: "It is, said he, as if I were one day to be a prisoner among the Crimean Tatars", the words that would prove prophetic—an allusion to Charles's enforced residence in the Ottoman territory after his defeat at the Battle of Poltava in 1709. 

Prince Alexander is a purported translator of The Testament of Basil the Macedonian into Georgian.

# Charles, Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried

Charles died in 1711 and was succeeded as Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried by his son William II.  After William's death in 1731, he was succeeded by his half-brother Christian, who died childless in 1755, thereby ending the Hessen-Wanfried line.

# Henry Darnall

  Darnall's Chance


Darnall died in 1711, stripped of his numerous offices but nonetheless extremely wealthy, having accumulated 30,000 acres (120 km2) of land.

A small portion of Darnall's former property, now called Darnall's Chance, can still be visited today. The house sits on several acres of a formerly large tract of land of thousands of acres patented in 1704 by Darnall. This plot was sold in 1741 by Darnalls' granddaughter Eleanor Darnall Carroll and her husband to James Wardrop, a merchant.  He built the house ca. 1742.  It was restored to its mid-eighteenth century state to reflect the life of Lettice Lee, who lived there for 30 years.

Darnall's stepson, Thomas Brooke, Jr. would become Governor of Maryland in 1720, under the new Calvert Proprietorship, restored by the King in 1715.

His sister Ursula Duncombe inherited half of Duncombe's fortune and was the ancestor of the present-day Barons Feversham.

# Giovanni Maria Gabrielli

He died on September 17, 1711, at the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, near Viterbo. According to his will, his corpse was buried in the church of San Bernardo alle Terme, his internal organs in that of Santa Pudenziana and his heart in the beloved basilica of San Sebastiano fuori le mura.

# Qazi Ghulam Mustafa

# Edward Hungerford (spendthrift)

# John William Friso, Prince of Orange

On coming of age in 1707, John William Friso became a general of the Dutch troops during the War of Spanish Succession, under the command of the Duke of Marlborough, and turned out to be a competent officer. He commanded Dutch infantry in the battle of Oudenarde, siege of Lille, and battle of Malplaquet. The prestige that he acquired from his military service should have favored his eventual elevation as stadtholder in the remaining five provinces. However, in 1711, when traveling from the front in Flanders to meet the King of Prussia in The Hague in connection with his suit in the succession dispute, he drowned on 14 July when the ferry boat on the Moerdyk was overturned in heavy weather. His son was born six weeks after his death.

# Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor

The Emperor was buried in the Imperial Crypt, resting place of the majority of the Habsburgs. His funeral took place on 20 April, in tomb no. 35 in Karl's Vault. His tomb was designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, decorated with pictures of various battles from the War of Spanish Succession. Josefstadt (the eighth district of Vienna) is named for Joseph.
