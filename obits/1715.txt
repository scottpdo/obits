# Sir Charles Barrington, 5th Baronet

On 20 April 1693, he married firstly Bridget Monson, daughter of Sir John Monson, 2nd Baronet, at St Bride's Church in London. She died in 1699 and Barrington remarried Hon. Anna Marie FitzWilliam, daughter of William FitzWilliam, 1st Earl FitzWilliam on 23 May 1700. He died childless and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his cousin John Shales, who changed his surname to Barrington as a condition of the inheritance. Barrington was buried at Hatfield Broad Oak in Essex.

# Gilbert Burnet

In 1714, as Queen Anne approached death, Burnet became briefly, and in the opinion of his critics, somewhat hysterically concerned about the dire consequences for Protestants if her Catholic half-brother, the Old Pretender, succeeded to the throne. His predictions of doom were received with general scepticism: "Be easy my Lord, and disturb not the peace of your old age with vain imaginings of a second Revolution and a flight to Holland... I am sure you need not die a martyr for your faith" wrote one correspondent acidly. In the event the throne passed peacefully to the Protestant House of Hanover in August 1714, seven months before Burnet's own death.

Burnet died of a fever on 17 March 1715, having been ill for only three days. His mood in his final days was described as being calm, cheerful and absolutely resigned to death. His will has been called one of those rare dispositions of one's property which please everyone: one third of his estate was left to his eldest son and the rest was divided among the other four children. What happened to his daughter Elizabeth's share of the money  is something of a puzzle, as she is known to have spent her last years in poverty.

# William Dampier

In 1708, Dampier was engaged to serve on the privateer Duke, not as captain but as sailing master. Duke beat its way into the South Pacific Ocean round Cape Horn in consort with a second ship, Duchess. Commanded by Woodes Rogers, this voyage was more successful: Selkirk was rescued on 2 February 1709, and the expedition amassed £147,975 (equivalent to £21.6 million today) worth of plundered goods. Most of that came from the capture of a Spanish galleon, Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño, along the coast of Mexico in December 1709.

In January 1710, Dampier crossed the Pacific in Duke, accompanied by Duchess and two prizes. They stopped at Guam before arriving in Batavia. Following a refit at Horn Island (near Batavia) and the sale of one of their prize ships, they sailed for the Cape of Good Hope where they remained for more than three months awaiting a convoy. They left the Cape in company with 25 Dutch and English ships, with Dampier now serving as sailing master of Encarnación. After a further delay at the Texel, they dropped anchor at the Thames in London on 14 October 1711.

Dampier may not have lived to receive all of his share of the expedition's gains. He died in the Parish of St Stephen Coleman Street, London. The exact date and circumstances of his death, and his final resting place, are all unknown. His will was proven on 23 March 1715, and it is generally assumed he died earlier that month, but this is not known with any certainty. His estate was almost £2,000 in debt.

# Joseph Deane

Barely eight months after taking office Deane died suddenly in May 1715, just after returning from his first assize. According to popular belief, as reported by  his friend Archbishop King,  his death was due to catching cold while watching the solar eclipse of May 3, 1715, as the weather  was  exceptionally cold and wet for May. Elrington Ball more prosaically states that  his death was probably due to gout. He was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.

# Gülnuş Sultan

  Interior of the dome of the Yeni Valide Mosque (Emetullah Râbi'a Gülnûş Sultan Mosque) in Üsküdar, Istanbul.


Gülnuş Sultan died on 6 November 1715 in Istanbul during the reign of her son Ahmed III just before the start of the era of prosperity and peace called the Tulip (Lâle) Era by the Turkish historians. She is buried at a tomb that is open to sky, that is near the mosque she bequeathed to be built at Üsküdar on the Anatolian side of Istanbul, called the Yeni Valide Mosque.

# Mirwais Hotak

  The mausoleum of Mirwais Hotak in the Kokaran section of Kandahar, Afghanistan.


Mirwais remained in power until his death in November 1715 and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, who was later killed by Mirwais' son Mahmud, allegedly for planning to give Kandahar's sovereignty back to Persia. In 1717, Mahmud took advantage of the political weakness of the Persian Shah (Sultan Husayn) and briefly conquered large parts Persia.

Mirwais is buried in his mausoleum in the Kokaran section of Kandahar, which is in the western end of the city. He is regarded as one of Afghanistan's greatest national heroes and admired by many Afghans, especially the Pashtuns. Steven Otfinoski referred to him as Afghanistan's George Washington in his 2004 book Afghanistan.

There is a neighborhood called Mirwais Mina as well as a hospital called Mirwais Hospital, a high school and a business center named after him in Kandahar.  There are also schools and a number of institutions or places across Afghanistan built to honor him. A few direct descendants of Mirwais are living today among the Hotak tribe.

# Sir William Langhorne, 1st Baronet

Langhorne amassed an enormous fortune through private illegal trade carried out during his tenure as the Agent of Madras and through trade with the Levant. Having arrived back in England he purchased the manor of Charlton, Kent in 1680.  This estate had previously been owned by William Ducie.  In 1707 he also purchased Hampstead, Middlesex. His marriage to Grace Chaworth, the Dowager Viscountess Chaworth, a sister of John Manners, 1st Duke of Rutland made him one of the richest men in England, despite lasting less than year before she died on 15 February 1700. On 16 October 1714 he remarried to one Mary Aston. He died on 26 February 1715 at the age of 85 without leaving behind any direct heirs to his fortune, his baronetcy became extinct on his death. He is buried in Charlton Parish Church.

Of his fortune, his will which was proved on 8 March 1715, left at least £1600 to be used in a similar manner to Queen Anne's Bounty, providing increased income to the clergy of poorer benefices.  The Charlton estate was inherited by Sir John Conyers, bt, his sister's son. and the Hampstead estate by his other nephew William Langhorn Games and after Games' death without male issue by a cousin, Margaret Maryon.

# Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick

He lived in London for the last years of his life and died on 14 December 1715. He was buried in Old St. Pancras churchyard, London.

# Louis XIV of France

  Louis XIV (seated) with his son le Grand Dauphin (to the left), his grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy (to the right), his great-grandson Louis Duke of Anjou, and Madame de Ventadour, Anjou's governess, who commissioned this painting; busts of Henry IV and Louis XIII are in the background.


Despite the image of a healthy and virile king that Louis sought to project, evidence exists to suggest that his health was not very good. He had many ailments: for example, symptoms of diabetes, as confirmed in reports of suppurating periostitis in 1678, dental abscesses in 1696, along with recurring boils, fainting spells, gout, dizziness, hot flushes, and headaches.

From 1647 to 1711, the three chief physicians to the king (Antoine Vallot, Antoine d'Aquin, and Guy-Crescent Fagon) recorded all of his health problems in the Journal de Santé du Roi (Journal of the King's Health), a daily report of his health. On 18 November 1686, Louis underwent a painful operation for an anal fistula that was performed by the surgeon Charles Felix de Tassy, who prepared a specially shaped curved scalpel for the occasion. The wound took more than two months to heal.

Louis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday, after 72 years on the throne. Enduring much pain in his last days, he finally "yielded up his soul without any effort, like a candle going out", while reciting the psalm Domine, ad adjuvandum me festina (O Lord, make haste to help me). His body was laid to rest in Saint-Denis Basilica outside Paris. It remained there undisturbed for about 80 years, until revolutionaries exhumed and destroyed all of the remains found in the Basilica.

# Marie Mancini

After the birth of her third child, relations between Marie and her husband deteriorated. On 29 May 1672, fearing that her husband would kill her, Marie left Rome accompanied by her sister Hortense. In 1677, in order to support herself, she wrote her memoirs. She did not return to Italy until her husband's death in 1689.

She died in Pisa and is buried in the church of the Holy Sepulchre there.

# Kate McNiven

  The Inchbrakie House Monument. The Graemes of Inchbrakie Coat of Arms is embedded on the main wall


After her death the Graemes of Inchbrakie incorporated the three crescent moons of the Nevins into the shield of their own coat of arms.[failed verification (See discussion.)] The Graemes of Inchbrakie Coat of Arms can still be viewed on the monument erected at Inchbrakie on the site of the original house which was demolished in 1888.

There is a modern-day rhyme in the village of Monzie that regards Nevin;



As long as the Shaggie rins crookit and bent
there’ll be a Witch o Mon-ie
And she’ll ne'er be kent

Warre died at Ghent 1 December 1718. and was buried with his ancestors at Kingston.  He had one son, Michael by his first marriage who was a Captain of Dragoons and who predeceased him, dying at Ghent. A son by his second wife died in infancy, and he had only a surviving daughter Margaret.
