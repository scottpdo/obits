Alderano Cybo



In 1676, Cybo was appointed Cardinal Secretary of State by Pope Innocent XI; he held the post until the death of Pope Innocent in 1689. 

In 1698, Cardinal Cybo held a diocesan synod at Velletri on 24 and 25 November. The constitutions of the synod were published.

Cybo died on 22 July 1700 in Rome, and was buried in the Cybo Chapel of the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, which he had radically rebuilt by Carlo Fontana and Carlo Maratta to glorify the achievements of his family.
