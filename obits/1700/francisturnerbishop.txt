Francis Turner (bishop)



No more is heard of Turner till his death, which occurred in London on 2 November 1700. He was buried on 5 November in the chancel at Therfield. His intestacy gave all his effects to his daughter Margaret (died 25 December 1724), wife of Richard Gulston of Wyddial Hall, Hertfordshire, thus disappointing the expectation of bequests to St. John's College, of which he had already been a benefactor.

Turner is an ancestor of Henrietta Euphemia Tindal (née Harrison), a 19th-century poet, who was the great granddaughter of a later Richard Gulston of Wyddial Hall, and of the Tindal-Carill-Worsley family.

Besides single sermons (1681–5) Turner published:



Animadversions on a Pamphlet entituled "The Naked Truth" (1676, anonymously; against Herbert Croft, Bishop of Hereford).
Letters to the Clergy of the Diocese of Ely (1686).


A portrait of Turner, painted probably by Mary Beale, was transferred from the British Museum to the National Portrait Gallery in 1879. He also figures in the anonymous portrait of the seven bishops in the same gallery.
